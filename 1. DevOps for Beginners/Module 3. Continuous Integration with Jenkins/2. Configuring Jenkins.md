# Installing and Configuring Jenkins
Jenkins is a powerful automation server that sits at the heart of many Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipelines. Before you can start automating your builds, tests, and deployments, you need to get Jenkins up and running. This lesson will guide you through the process of installing and configuring Jenkins, setting the stage for building your first CI pipeline. We'll cover different installation methods, initial setup, plugin management, and basic security configurations.

Installation Options
--------------------

Jenkins offers several installation methods, each suited to different operating systems and environments. The most common methods include:

*   **Native Packages:** Installing Jenkins using package managers like apt (Debian/Ubuntu), yum (Red Hat/CentOS), or brew (macOS). This is often the simplest method for local development or testing.
    
*   **Docker:** Running Jenkins in a Docker container provides a consistent and isolated environment. This is ideal for production deployments and ensures that Jenkins behaves the same way regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
    
*   **Web Application Archive (WAR):** Deploying Jenkins as a WAR file to a Java application server like Tomcat or Jetty. This method offers flexibility but requires more manual configuration.
    

Let's explore each of these options in more detail.

### Installing with Native Packages (Debian/Ubuntu)

For Debian-based systems like Ubuntu, you can use the apt package manager. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1.  curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \\ /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
    
2.  echo deb \[signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc\] \\ https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \\ /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    
3.  sudo apt update
    
4.  sudo apt install jenkins
    
5.  sudo systemctl start jenkins
    
6.  sudo systemctl status jenkinsThis command will show you the status of the Jenkins service, including whether it's active and any recent log messages.
    

### Installing with Native Packages (Red Hat/CentOS)

For Red Hat-based systems like CentOS or Fedora, you can use the yum package manager. Here's how:

1.  sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo <
    
2.  sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
    
3.  sudo yum install jenkins
    
4.  sudo systemctl start jenkins
    
5.  sudo systemctl status jenkins
    

### Installing with Docker

Docker provides a convenient way to run Jenkins in a containerized environment. This ensures consistency and simplifies deployment.

1.  docker pull jenkins/jenkins:ltsThis command downloads the latest Long-Term Support (LTS) version of the Jenkins image from Docker Hub. The LTS version is recommended for stability.
    
2.  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v jenkins\_home:/var/jenkins\_home jenkins/jenkins:ltsLet's break down this command:
    
    *   \-d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
        
    *   \-p 8080:8080: Maps port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container (Jenkins web UI).
        
    *   \-p 50000:50000: Maps port 50000 on the host to port 50000 in the container (Jenkins agent communication).
        
    *   \-v jenkins\_home:/var/jenkins\_home: Creates a named volume jenkins\_home and mounts it to /var/jenkins\_home in the container. This ensures that your Jenkins data persists even if the container is stopped or removed.
        
    *   jenkins/jenkins:lts: Specifies the image to use.
        
3.  **Access Jenkins:** Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 (or the appropriate IP address and port if you're running Docker on a remote machine).
    

### Installing with WAR File

This method involves downloading the Jenkins WAR file and deploying it to a Java application server like Tomcat.

1.  **Download the Jenkins WAR file:** You can download the latest stable version from the Jenkins website.
    
2.  **Deploy the WAR file:** Copy the WAR file to the webapps directory of your Tomcat installation.
    
3.  **Start Tomcat:** Tomcat will automatically deploy the WAR file and start Jenkins.
    
4.  **Access Jenkins:** Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jenkins (or the appropriate URL for your Tomcat installation).
    

Initial Setup
-------------

After installing Jenkins, you'll need to perform some initial setup steps. These steps include:

1.  Please copy the administrator password from: /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPasswordUse the cat command to view the contents of this file:sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPasswordCopy the password and paste it into the "Administrator password" field in the Jenkins web UI.
    
2.  **Installing Suggested Plugins:** Jenkins will then ask you whether you want to install suggested plugins or select plugins to install. The "Install suggested plugins" option is generally recommended for beginners, as it installs a set of commonly used plugins that provide basic functionality.
    
3.  **Creating the First Administrator User:** After installing the plugins, you'll be prompted to create the first administrator user. Enter the desired username, password, full name, and email address. This user will have full access to Jenkins.
    

Configuring Jenkins
-------------------

Once you've completed the initial setup, you can start configuring Jenkins to suit your needs. Some common configuration tasks include:

### Managing Plugins

Plugins extend Jenkins' functionality and allow it to integrate with various tools and services. You can manage plugins from the Jenkins web UI by navigating to **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins**.

*   **Available:** This tab lists plugins that are available for installation.
    
*   **Installed:** This tab lists plugins that are already installed.
    
*   **Updates:** This tab lists plugins that have updates available.
    
*   **Advanced:** This tab allows you to configure plugin update settings and upload custom plugins.
    

To install a plugin, simply select it from the "Available" tab and click the "Install without restart" button. After the installation is complete, you may need to restart Jenkins for the changes to take effect.

### Configuring Global Tool Configuration

Jenkins needs to know where to find the tools it uses to build and test your projects, such as Git, Java, and Maven. You can configure these tools globally by navigating to **Manage Jenkins > Global Tool Configuration**.

For each tool, you can either provide the path to an existing installation or have Jenkins automatically install the tool. The automatic installation option is convenient, but it requires Jenkins to have the necessary permissions to download and install software.

For example, to configure Git, you can either specify the path to the git executable or select the "Install automatically" option and choose a Git version to install.

### Configuring System Settings

Jenkins provides a variety of system settings that you can configure to customize its behavior. These settings can be found under **Manage Jenkins > Configure System**.

Some common system settings include:

*   **Jenkins URL:** The URL that Jenkins uses to access itself. This is important for plugins that need to generate links to Jenkins.
    
*   **System Message:** A message that is displayed on the Jenkins dashboard. This can be used to communicate important information to users.
    
*   **Number of executors:** The number of concurrent builds that Jenkins can run. This depends on the resources available on the Jenkins server.
    

Basic Security Configuration
----------------------------

Securing your Jenkins instance is crucial, especially if it's accessible from the internet. Here are some basic security measures you should take:

1.  **Enable Security:** By default, Jenkins runs without any security enabled. To enable security, navigate to **Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security**.
    
2.  **Choose an Authentication Strategy:** Select an authentication strategy. The most common options are:
    
    *   **Jenkins’ own user database:** This is the simplest option and is suitable for small teams.
        
    *   **LDAP:** This allows you to authenticate users against an LDAP server.
        
    *   **Delegate to servlet container:** This allows you to use the authentication mechanism provided by your Java application server.
        
3.  **Choose an Authorization Strategy:** Select an authorization strategy. The most common options are:
    
    *   **Anyone can do anything:** This is the least secure option and should only be used for testing purposes.
        
    *   **Logged-in users can do anything:** This allows any logged-in user to perform any action in Jenkins.
        
    *   **Matrix-based security:** This allows you to define fine-grained permissions for users and groups.
        
    *   **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy:** This allows you to define permissions for users and groups on a per-project basis.
        
4.  **Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits:** Enable this option to protect against CSRF attacks.
    
5.  **Save the Configuration:** Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.
    

After enabling security, you'll need to create at least one user with administrative privileges.

ExampleCorp and Jenkins Installation
------------------------------------

Let's imagine that ExampleCorp wants to use Jenkins to automate the build and testing of their new web application. They decide to install Jenkins on a dedicated virtual machine running Ubuntu.

Following the steps outlined above, they add the Jenkins repository, install the Jenkins package, and start the Jenkins service. They then access Jenkins through their web browser and unlock it using the administrator password.

During the initial setup, they choose to install the suggested plugins, which include plugins for Git integration, build automation, and testing. They also create an administrator user with a strong password.

Finally, they configure the global tool configuration to point to the location of Git and Java on the virtual machine. They also enable security and configure Jenkins to use its own user database for authentication and the matrix-based security for authorization.

With Jenkins installed and configured, ExampleCorp is now ready to start creating their first CI pipeline.

Practice Activities
-------------------

1.  **Install Jenkins using Docker:** Follow the steps outlined above to install Jenkins using Docker. Experiment with different port mappings and volume configurations.
    
2.  **Explore the Jenkins web UI:** Familiarize yourself with the different sections of the Jenkins web UI, such as the dashboard, the job configuration page, and the plugin manager.
    
3.  **Configure global tool configuration:** Configure Jenkins to use a specific version of Git or Java.
    
4.  **Enable security:** Enable security on your Jenkins instance and create a new user with limited privileges.
