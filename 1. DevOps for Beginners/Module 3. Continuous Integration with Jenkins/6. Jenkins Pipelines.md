# Introduction to Jenkins Pipelines
Jenkins pipelines are a fundamental aspect of modern continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices. They allow you to define your entire build, test, and deployment process as code, enabling automation, repeatability, and version control. This lesson will introduce you to the core concepts of Jenkins pipelines, their benefits, and how they differ from traditional Jenkins jobs. We'll explore the different types of pipelines and the basic syntax used to define them.

### Understanding Jenkins Pipelines


A Jenkins pipeline is a suite of automation tools that strings together multiple jobs, or stages, in a sequence. It defines the entire software release process, from code commit to production deployment, as a single, executable workflow. This "pipeline as code" approach offers several advantages over traditional, GUI-based Jenkins jobs.

### Key Concepts

*   **Pipeline as Code:** The entire CI/CD process is defined in a text file (Jenkinsfile) that can be version-controlled alongside the application code. This promotes transparency, auditability, and collaboration.
    
*   **Stages:** A pipeline is divided into stages, each representing a distinct phase of the process (e.g., build, test, deploy). Stages provide a high-level overview of the pipeline's progress.
    
*   **Steps:** Each stage consists of one or more steps, which are the actual commands or actions to be executed (e.g., compiling code, running tests, deploying to a server).
    
*   **Nodes:** A node represents a machine or agent where the pipeline steps are executed. Jenkins distributes the workload across available nodes to improve efficiency.
    
*   **Declarative vs. Scripted Pipeline Syntax:** Jenkins supports two main syntaxes for defining pipelines: Declarative and Scripted. Declarative pipelines offer a more structured and easier-to-read syntax, while Scripted pipelines provide greater flexibility and control.
    

### Benefits of Using Pipelines

*   **Automation:** Pipelines automate the entire CI/CD process, reducing manual effort and the risk of human error.
    
*   **Repeatability:** Pipelines ensure that the build, test, and deployment process is consistent and repeatable across different environments.
    
*   **Version Control:** Pipelines are defined as code and stored in version control systems like Git, allowing you to track changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate effectively.
    
*   **Visibility:** Pipelines provide a clear and visual representation of the entire CI/CD process, making it easier to monitor progress, identify bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues.
    
*   **Scalability:** Pipelines can be easily scaled to handle complex and demanding CI/CD workflows.
    
*   **Faster Feedback Loops:** By automating the build and test process, pipelines enable faster feedback loops, allowing developers to identify and fix issues early in the development cycle.
    

### Declarative vs. Scripted Pipelines

Jenkins offers two primary ways to define pipelines: Declarative and Scripted.

| Feature | Declarative Pipeline in the Declarative style, you define the structure of the pipeline, and Jenkins takes care of the execution details. In the Scripted style, you have more control over the execution flow, but you also need to handle more of the details yourself. | Use Case | Declarative Pipeline

*   Jenkins is best suited for beginner's friendly and easy to learn.
    
*   Scripted Pipeline is best suited for complex CI/CD workflows.
    

### Example Declarative Pipeline

pipeline {
    agent any  // Execute the pipeline on any available agent
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                // Add build steps here (e.g., mvn clean install)
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running tests...'
                // Add test steps here (e.g., mvn test)
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                // Add deployment steps here (e.g., deploying to a server)
            }
        }
    }
}

This example defines a simple declarative pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. Each stage contains a single step that prints a message to the console. In a real-world scenario, these steps would be replaced with actual build, test, and deployment commands.

### Example Scripted Pipeline

node {
    stage('Build') {
        echo 'Building the application...'
        // Add build steps here (e.g., sh 'mvn clean install')
    }
    stage('Test') {
        echo 'Running tests...'
        // Add test steps here (e.g., sh 'mvn test')
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
        echo 'Deploying the application...'
        // Add deployment steps here (e.g., sh 'deploy.sh')
    }
}

This example defines a simple scripted pipeline with three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy. Each stage contains a single step that prints a message to the console. In a real-world scenario, these steps would be replaced with actual build, test, and deployment commands.

Basic Pipeline Syntax
---------------------

Understanding the basic syntax of Jenkins pipelines is crucial for defining and customizing your CI/CD workflows. This section covers the essential elements of pipeline syntax, including the pipeline, agent, stages, stage, and steps directives.

### The pipeline Block

The pipeline block is the top-level element that encapsulates the entire pipeline definition. It is required for all declarative pipelines.

pipeline {
    // Pipeline definition goes here
}

### The agent Directive

The agent directive specifies where the pipeline will be executed. It can be used at the top level of the pipeline or within individual stages. Common agent options include:

*   any: Execute the pipeline on any available agent.
    
*   none: No global agent is specified; each stage must define its own agent.
    
*   label 'label-name': Execute the pipeline on an agent with the specified label.
    
*   docker 'image-name': Execute the pipeline within a Docker container based on the specified image.
    

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            agent {
                docker 'maven:3.8.1-openjdk-11'
            }
            steps {
                // Build steps executed inside the Docker container
            }
        }
    }
}

### The stages Block

The stages block contains a sequence of one or more stage blocks. Each stage represents a distinct phase of the pipeline.

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            // Build stage definition
        }
        stage('Test') {
            // Test stage definition
        }
    }
}

### The stage Block

The stage block defines a specific stage in the pipeline. It must contain a steps block that specifies the actions to be performed in that stage.

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Steps to be executed in the Build stage
            }
        }
    }
}

### The steps Block

The steps block contains a sequence of one or more steps to be executed within a stage. Each step represents a specific action, such as executing a shell command, running a test, or deploying an application.

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
    }
}

### Example Pipeline with Multiple Stages and Steps

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                echo 'Checking out code from Git...'
                git 'https://github.com/ExampleCorp/my-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running unit tests...'
                sh 'mvn test'
                echo 'Running integration tests...'
                sh 'mvn verify'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application to staging...'
                sh './deploy-staging.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}

This example demonstrates a more complete pipeline with multiple stages and steps. It includes stages for checking out code from Git, building the application, running tests, and deploying to a staging environment.

Practical Examples and Demonstrations
-------------------------------------

Let's explore some practical examples of Jenkins pipelines to illustrate how they can be used to automate different CI/CD workflows.

### Example 1: Building and Testing a Java Application

This example demonstrates a pipeline that builds and tests a Java application using Maven.

pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        MAVEN_HOME = '/usr/local/maven'
        PATH = "$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$PATH"
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/ExampleCorp/my-java-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Archive Artifacts') {
            steps {
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'target/*.jar', fingerprint: true
            }
        }
    }
}

This pipeline defines an environment block to set the MAVEN\_HOME and PATH environment variables, ensuring that Maven is available during the build process. It also includes a stage for archiving the build artifacts (JAR files) using the archiveArtifacts step.

### Example 2: Deploying a Web Application to a Tomcat Server

This example demonstrates a pipeline that deploys a web application to a Tomcat server.

pipeline {
    agent any

    environment {
        TOMCAT_HOME = '/opt/tomcat'
    }

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/ExampleCorp/my-web-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                sh "cp target/*.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/"
                sh "$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh"
                sh "$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/startup.sh"
            }
        }
    }
}

This pipeline defines an environment block to set the TOMCAT\_HOME environment variable. The Deploy stage copies the WAR file to the Tomcat webapps directory and restarts the Tomcat server.

### Example 3: Using Input to Trigger a Manual Approval Step

This example demonstrates how to use the input step to add a manual approval step to the pipeline.

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/ExampleCorp/my-app.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn test'
            }
        }
        stage('Approval') {
            steps {
                input message: 'Approve deployment to production?', ok: 'Deploy'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying to production...'
                sh './deploy-production.sh'
            }
        }
    }
}

The Approval stage uses the input step to prompt the user to approve the deployment to production. The pipeline will pause until the user clicks the "Deploy" button.
