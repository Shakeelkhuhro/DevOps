# Creating Your First Jenkins Job

Jenkins is the leading **open-source automation server*. In this lesson, we'll walk through the process of creating your first Jenkins job, also known as a "project." This is the foundation for automating your build, test, and deployment processes. We'll cover the essential configuration options and demonstrate how to set up a basic job that you can then expand upon in later lessons.

## Understanding Jenkins Jobs

A Jenkins job is a configurable, repeatable task that Jenkins executes. It's the core building block of any CI/CD pipeline. Think of it as a recipe: you define the steps, and Jenkins follows them. Jobs can be triggered manually, scheduled, or automatically triggered by events like code commits.

### Types of Jenkins Jobs

Jenkins offers several types of jobs, each suited for different purposes. Here are the most common ones:

- **Freestyle project**: This is the most flexible type, allowing you to define arbitrary build steps using shell commands, batch scripts, or other build tools. It's a good starting point for simple automation tasks.  
    Example: A freestyle project could compile Java code, run unit tests, and archive the resulting JAR file.  
    Another Example: A freestyle project could execute a Python script that performs some data processing and generates a report.
  
- **Pipeline**: Pipelines define your entire CI/CD process as code, using a Groovy-based DSL (Domain Specific Language). This allows for more complex and maintainable workflows. We will cover this in a later lesson.  
    Example: A pipeline could build a Docker image, push it to a registry, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster.  
    Another Example: A pipeline could run static analysis tools, perform integration tests, and deploy the application to a staging environment.

- **Multibranch Pipeline**: This type automatically creates pipelines for each branch in your Git repository, allowing you to test changes in isolation.  
    Example: A multibranch pipeline could build and test each feature branch in your repository whenever a new commit is pushed.  
    Another Example: A multibranch pipeline could deploy a preview environment for each pull request, allowing reviewers to test the changes before they are merged.

- **Maven project**: Specifically designed for building Maven-based Java projects. It automatically detects Maven configuration and dependencies.  
    Example: A Maven project could compile Java code, run unit tests, generate Javadoc, and package the application into a WAR file.  
    Another Example: A Maven project could deploy the application to a Maven repository.

- **External Job**: This type allows Jenkins to monitor and display the results of jobs that are executed outside of Jenkins.  
    Example: An external job could monitor the status of a long-running data processing job that is executed on a separate server.  
    Another Example: An external job could monitor the status of a security scan that is performed by a third-party tool.

For this lesson, we'll focus on the **Freestyle project** type, as it provides a simple and straightforward way to get started with Jenkins.

## Creating a New Job

Let's create our first Jenkins job.

1. **Access Jenkins**: Open your web browser and navigate to your Jenkins instance (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`).
2. **New Item**: Click on "New Item" in the Jenkins dashboard.
3. **Enter Item Name**: Enter a name for your job (e.g., "My-First-Job"). Choose a descriptive name that reflects the job's purpose.
4. **Select Freestyle project**: Select "Freestyle project" and click "OK".

### Configuring Your Job

Now, you'll be presented with the job configuration page. This is where you define the details of your job.

#### General Settings

- **Description**: Add a brief description of what the job does. This is helpful for other users to understand the job's purpose.  
  Example: "This job compiles the ExampleCorp application and runs unit tests."
  
- **Discard old builds**: Configure how many old builds to keep. This helps to manage disk space. You can specify the number of builds to keep or the number of days to keep them.  
  Example: Keep only the last 5 builds.  
  Another Example: Keep builds for the last 7 days.

- **Disable this project**: If you want to temporarily disable the job without deleting it, check this box.

#### Source Code Management

This section is where you configure how Jenkins retrieves your source code. Since we covered Git in the previous module, we'll integrate our job with a Git repository.

- **Select Git**: Choose "Git" as the source code management system.
- **Repository URL**: Enter the URL of your Git repository. For example, `https://github.com/ExampleCorp/my-repo.git`.
- **Credentials**: If your repository is private, you'll need to add credentials. Click the "Add" button next to the "Credentials" dropdown and select "Jenkins." Enter your username and password (or a Git token) and click "Add."
- **Branch Specifier**: Specify the branch to build (e.g., `*/main` or `*/develop`). The `*/` prefix matches any remote repository.

#### Build Triggers

This section defines how the job is triggered.

- **Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts)**: Allows you to trigger the job via an API call. This is useful for integrating Jenkins with other tools.
- **Poll SCM**: Jenkins periodically checks the Git repository for changes. If changes are detected, the job is triggered. This is a simple way to automate builds, but it can be resource-intensive.  
  Example: Poll the repository every 5 minutes.
  
- **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**: This is the preferred method for triggering builds from GitHub. When a commit is pushed to the repository, GitHub sends a webhook to Jenkins, which triggers the job. This is more efficient than polling. You'll need to configure a webhook in your GitHub repository settings.

- **Build after other projects are built**: This allows you to chain jobs together. When the specified upstream job completes successfully, this job is triggered.  
  Example: Trigger this job after the "Compile" job completes.
  
- **Build periodically**: This allows you to schedule the job to run at specific times. You can use cron expressions to define the schedule.  
  Example: Run the job every night at midnight: `0 0 * * *`.

For now, let's select "Poll SCM" and set the schedule to `H/5 * * * *`. This will poll the repository every 5 minutes.

#### Build Environment

This section allows you to configure the environment in which the build will run.

- **Delete workspace before build starts**: This ensures that the workspace is clean before each build. This can prevent issues caused by leftover files from previous builds.
- **Use secret text(s) or file(s)**: This allows you to securely store and use sensitive information, such as passwords or API keys, in your build scripts.
- **Provide Configuration files**: This allows you to provide configuration files to your build process.

#### Build Steps

This is where you define the actual steps that the job will execute. You can add multiple build steps, each performing a specific task.

1. **Add build step**: Click the "Add build step" dropdown.
2. **Execute shell**: Select "Execute shell" (or "Execute Windows batch command" if you're using Windows).
3. **Command**: Enter the shell commands to execute. For example:

```bash
echo "Hello, world!"
echo "Building the ExampleCorp application..."
# Add your build commands here (e.g., compile, test, package)
````

This simple script will print "Hello, world!" and "Building the ExampleCorp application..." to the console. You can replace these with your actual build commands.

* **Example**: If you have a Maven project, you could use the following command to compile the code and run unit tests:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

* **Another Example**: If you have a Node.js project, you could use the following commands to install dependencies and run tests:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

#### Post-build Actions

This section defines actions to be performed after the build completes, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails.

* **Publish JUnit test result report**: If your build generates JUnit test reports, you can use this action to publish them in Jenkins.
* **Archive the artifacts**: This allows you to save the build artifacts (e.g., JAR files, WAR files, Docker images) to Jenkins.
* **Email Notification**: Send email notifications to specified recipients based on the build result (success, failure, etc.).
* **Trigger/call builds on other projects**: Trigger other Jenkins jobs after this job completes.

For now, let's add an "Archive the artifacts" action. Enter `**/*` in the "Files to archive" field to archive all files in the workspace.

## Running Your Job

1. **Save**: Click "Save" at the bottom of the configuration page.
2. **Build Now**: Click "Build Now" on the job's page. This will manually trigger the job.
3. **View Console Output**: Click on the build number (e.g., "#1") in the "Build History" section. Then, click "Console Output" to see the output of the job.

You should see the "Hello, world!" and "Building the ExampleCorp application..." messages printed in the console. If you configured Git integration, you should also see messages related to checking out the code from your repository.

## Practice Activities

* **Modify the build script**: Change the shell commands in the "Execute shell" build step to perform a different task. For example, try listing the files in the workspace using the `ls -l` command.
* **Integrate with a real Git repository**: If you haven't already, configure the job to use a real Git repository. Make sure to add the necessary credentials if the repository is private.
* **Add email notifications**: Configure email notifications to be sent when the build succeeds or fails. You'll need to configure Jenkins' email settings first.
* **Explore other build steps**: Experiment with other build steps, such as "Invoke Ant" or "Invoke Maven."

## Summary and Next Steps

In this lesson, you learned how to create your first Jenkins job, configure its basic settings, integrate it with Git, and define build steps. You also learned how to trigger the job manually and view its console output.

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into integrating Git with Jenkins, including setting up automated builds triggered by Git commits. We'll also explore more advanced build triggers and learn how to use webhooks.
