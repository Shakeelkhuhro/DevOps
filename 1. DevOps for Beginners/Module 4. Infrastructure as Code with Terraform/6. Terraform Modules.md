# Introduction to Terraform Modules

Terraform modules are a fundamental building block for creating reusable, maintainable, and scalable infrastructure as code. They allow you to encapsulate and abstract away complex configurations, making it easier to manage and deploy infrastructure across different environments and projects. By understanding and utilizing modules effectively, you can significantly improve your Terraform workflow and reduce code duplication.

## Understanding Terraform Modules

A Terraform module is a container for multiple Terraform resources that are used together. Modules are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that can be used across multiple projects. They help in organizing and reusing code, making infrastructure management more efficient and consistent.

### What is a Module?

At its core, a module is simply a directory containing Terraform configuration files. This directory typically includes a main.tf file, which defines the resources to be managed, as well as other files such as variables.tf (for defining input variables) and outputs.tf (for defining output values).

Think of a module as a function in a programming language. It takes inputs (variables), performs some actions (creates or modifies resources), and returns outputs (values that can be used elsewhere).

### Benefits of Using Modules

- **Reusability:** Modules can be used across multiple projects, reducing code duplication and ensuring consistency.
- **Organization:** Modules help to organize complex infrastructure configurations into smaller, more manageable units.
- **Abstraction:** Modules abstract away the details of the underlying infrastructure, making it easier for others to use and understand.
- **Maintainability:** Changes to a module can be made in one place and propagated to all projects that use the module.
- **Collaboration:** Modules facilitate collaboration by allowing different teams to work on different parts of the infrastructure independently.

### Module Structure

A typical Terraform module directory structure looks like this:

```hcl
module_name/
├── main.tf        # Defines the resources to be managed
├── variables.tf   # Defines input variables
├── outputs.tf     # Defines output values
└── README.md      # Documentation for the module
```

- main.tf: This file contains the core logic of the module, defining the resources that will be created or managed.
- variables.tf: This file defines the input variables that the module accepts. Variables allow you to customize the behavior of the module without modifying the code directly.
- outputs.tf: This file defines the output values that the module exposes. Outputs allow you to access information about the resources created by the module.
- README.md: This file provides documentation for the module, including instructions on how to use it, descriptions of the input variables, and examples of how to use the output values.

## Creating Your First Module

Let's create a simple module that creates an AWS S3 bucket.

### Step 1: Create a Module Directory

Create a new directory for your module, for example, modules/s3-bucket.

```bash
mkdir -p modules/s3-bucket
cd modules/s3-bucket
```

### Step 2: Define the Resources in main.tf

Create a main.tf file in the modules/s3-bucket directory and add the following code:

```hcl
# modules/s3-bucket/main.tf

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "default" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  acl    = var.acl
  tags = {
    Name = var.bucket_name
  }
}
```

This code defines an AWS S3 bucket resource. The bucket and acl attributes are set using input variables, which we will define in the next step.

### Step 3: Define Input Variables in variables.tf

Create a variables.tf file in the modules/s3-bucket directory and add the following code:

```hcl
# modules/s3-bucket/variables.tf

variable "bucket_name" {
  type        = string
  description = "The name of the S3 bucket"
}

variable "acl" {
  type        = string
  description = "The ACL of the S3 bucket"
  default     = "private"
}
```

This code defines two input variables: bucket_name and acl. The bucket_name variable is required, while the acl variable has a default value of "private".

### Step 4: Define Output Values in outputs.tf

Create an outputs.tf file in the modules/s3-bucket directory and add the following code:

```hcl
# modules/s3-bucket/outputs.tf

output "bucket_id" {
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.default.id
  description = "The ID of the S3 bucket"
}

output "bucket_arn" {
  value       = aws_s3_bucket.default.arn
  description = "The ARN of the S3 bucket"
}

```

This code defines two output values: bucket_id and bucket_arn. These values can be used by other modules or resources that depend on the S3 bucket.

### Step 5: Using the Module in Your Configuration

Now that you have created your first module, you can use it in your Terraform configuration. Create a new directory for your project, for example, my-project.

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
```

Create a main.tf file in the my-project directory and add the following code:

```hcl
# my-project/main.tf

module "s3_bucket" {
  source      = "../modules/s3-bucket"
  bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl         = "public-read"
}

output "s3_bucket_id" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_id
}

output "s3_bucket_arn" {
  value = module.s3_bucket.bucket_arn
}
```

This code uses the s3-bucket module that you created earlier. The source attribute specifies the path to the module directory. The bucket_name and acl attributes are set to specific values. The output values from the module are accessed using the *module.s3_bucket.bucket_id* and *module.s3_bucket.bucket_arn* syntax.

### Step 6: Initialize, Plan, and Apply

Initialize your Terraform project:

```bash
terraform init
```

Plan your changes to see what resources will be created:

```bash
terraform plan
```

Apply the changes to create the S3 bucket:

```bash
terraform apply
```

This will create an S3 bucket with the specified name and ACL.

## Module Sources

The source argument in a module block specifies where to find the module code. Terraform supports various module sources, including:

- **Local Path:** A local directory on your file system (as shown in the previous example).
- **Terraform Registry:** A public or private registry of Terraform modules.
- **Git Repository:** A Git repository containing Terraform code.
- **HTTP URL:** A URL pointing to a ZIP archive containing Terraform code.

### Local Path

As demonstrated in the previous example, a local path is a simple way to use modules that are stored on your local file system. The source argument is set to the relative or absolute path to the module directory
```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source      = "../modules/s3-bucket"
  bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl         = "public-read"
}
```

### Terraform Registry
The Terraform Registry is a public repository of Terraform modules that are maintained by HashiCorp and the Terraform community. You can use modules from the Terraform Registry by specifying the module's name and version in the source argument.

For example, to use the aws-vpc module from the Terraform Registry, you would add the following code to your configuration:
```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "3.0.0"

  name = "my-vpc"
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"

  azs             = ["us-east-1a", "us-east-1b", "us-east-1c"]
  private_subnets = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
  public_subnets  = ["10.0.101.0/24", "10.0.102.0/24", "10.0.103.0/24"]

  enable_nat_gateway = true
  single_nat_gateway = true

  tags = {
    Terraform = "true"
    Environment = "dev"
  }
}
```
This code specifies the module's name (terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws) and version (3.0.0). Terraform will automatically download the module from the Terraform Registry and use it in your configuration.

### Git Repository
You can also use modules that are stored in a Git repository. The source argument is set to the Git repository URL, followed by a double slash (//) and the path to the module directory within the repository.

For example, to use a module from a Git repository, you would add the following code to your configuration:
```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/example/terraform-modules.git//s3-bucket"
  bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl = "public-read"
}
```

You can also specify a specific branch, tag, or commit by adding a ?ref= query parameter to the URL:
```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/example/terraform-modules.git//s3-bucket?ref=v1.0.0"
  bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl = "public-read"
}
```

### HTTP URL
You can also use modules that are stored as ZIP archives on an HTTP server. The source argument is set to the URL of the ZIP archive.

For example, to use a module from an HTTP URL, you would add the following code to your configuration:
```hcl
module "s3_bucket" {
  source = "https://example.com/terraform-modules/s3-bucket.zip"
  bucket_name = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl = "public-read"
}
```

Module Versions
---------------

When using modules from the Terraform Registry or a Git repository, it is important to specify a version for the module. This ensures that your configuration is reproducible and that you are using a known and tested version of the module.

### Version Constraints

Terraform uses version constraints to specify the acceptable versions of a module. Version constraints are specified using a combination of operators and version numbers.

*   \=: Specifies an exact version.
    
*   \>: Specifies a version greater than the specified version.
    
*   \>=: Specifies a version greater than or equal to the specified version.
    
*   <: Specifies a version less than the specified version.
    
*   <=: Specifies a version less than or equal to the specified version.
    
*   ~>: Specifies a version that is approximately greater than or equal to the specified version. This operator is useful for specifying a range of compatible versions.
    

For example, to specify that you want to use version 3.0.0 or later of the aws-vpc module, you would use the following version constraint:
```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = ">= 3.0.0"

  # ...
}
```

To specify that you want to use any version of the aws-vpc module that is compatible with version 3.0, you would use the following version constraint:
```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "~> 3.0"

  # ...
}
```

Best Practices for Using Modules
--------------------------------

*   **Keep modules small and focused:** Each module should have a single, well-defined purpose.
    
*   **Use input variables to customize module behavior:** Input variables allow you to customize the behavior of a module without modifying the code directly.
    
*   **Use output values to expose information about the resources created by the module:** Output values allow you to access information about the resources created by the module.
    
*   **Document your modules:** Provide clear and concise documentation for your modules, including instructions on how to use them, descriptions of the input variables, and examples of how to use the output values.
    
*   **Use version control:** Store your modules in a version control system, such as Git, to track changes and collaborate with others.
    
*   **Use a module registry:** Consider using a module registry, such as the Terraform Registry, to share your modules with others and discover modules that you can use in your own projects.
    

ExampleCorp and Modules
-----------------------

Let's imagine ExampleCorp is expanding its infrastructure to support a new application. They need to create a new VPC, subnets, and security groups. Instead of writing the Terraform code from scratch, they can use modules to simplify the process.

They could use a pre-built module from the Terraform Registry for creating a VPC, and then create their own modules for configuring security groups and subnets. This approach allows them to reuse code, reduce errors, and accelerate the deployment process.

For instance, they might use the terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws module to create the VPC, and then create a custom module for their application's security groups, ensuring that the correct ports are open for communication.

Practice Activities
-------------------

1.  **Create a module for creating an AWS EC2 instance.** The module should accept input variables for the instance type, AMI ID, and key name. It should output the instance ID and public IP address.
    
2.  **Create a module for creating an AWS security group.** The module should accept input variables for the VPC ID and a list of ingress rules. It should output the security group ID.
    
3.  **Use the modules you created in the previous exercises to create an EC2 instance and a security group in a VPC.**
    

Summary and Next Steps
