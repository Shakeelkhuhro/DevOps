# Managing Infrastructure with Terraform: Create, Update, Destroy

Terraform is a powerful tool for managing infrastructure as code, and understanding how to create, update, and destroy resources is fundamental to using it effectively. This lesson will delve into the core Terraform workflow, providing you with the knowledge and practical skills to manage your infrastructure lifecycle. We'll build upon the foundational concepts introduced in previous lessons, such as Terraform configuration files and providers, and prepare you for more advanced topics like Terraform modules.

## Creating Infrastructure with Terraform

The process of creating infrastructure with Terraform begins with defining the desired state of your infrastructure in Terraform configuration files (typically with a .tf extension). These files describe the resources you want to create, their attributes, and any dependencies between them.

### Writing Terraform Configuration

Let's revisit the "ExampleCorp" project. Suppose ExampleCorp needs to provision a simple web server on AWS. The Terraform configuration might look like this:

```hcl
# Configure the AWS Provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2" # Replace with your desired region
}

# Create a security group to allow HTTP traffic
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  name        = "web-sg"
  description = "Allow HTTP traffic"
  vpc_id      = "vpc-12345678" # Replace with your VPC ID

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# Create an EC2 instance
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b24647433a073" # Replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_sg.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleCorp Web Server"
  }
}
```

_Explanation:_

- terraform block: Specifies the required providers and their versions. This ensures that the correct provider versions are used.
- provider "aws" block: Configures the AWS provider with the desired region. You'll need to replace "us-west-2" with the AWS region you want to use.
- resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" block: Defines a security group named "web-sg" that allows HTTP traffic (port 80) from anywhere. You'll need to replace "vpc-12345678" with your actual VPC ID.
- resource "aws_instance" "web_server" block: Defines an EC2 instance named "web_server" using a specific AMI and instance type. You'll need to replace "ami-0c55b24647433a073" with a valid AMI ID for your region. The security_groups argument associates the EC2 instance with the security group we defined.

### Terraform Initialization

Before you can create infrastructure, you need to initialize the Terraform working directory. This is done using the terraform init command. This command downloads the necessary provider plugins and prepares the working directory for use.

```bash
   terraform init
```

_Explanation:_

- terraform init: This command initializes the Terraform working directory. It downloads the necessary provider plugins (in this case, the AWS provider) and sets up the backend (where Terraform stores its state).

### Planning the Infrastructure

The terraform plan command creates an execution plan, which shows you what Terraform will do to create the infrastructure defined in your configuration files. This is a crucial step for verifying that your configuration is correct and that Terraform will create the resources you expect.

````
```bash
 terraform plan
````

_Explanation:_

- terraform plan: This command generates an execution plan. It compares the current state of your infrastructure (as stored in the Terraform state file) with the desired state defined in your configuration files. The output shows you exactly what Terraform will do: which resources will be created, modified, or destroyed.

### Applying the Configuration

Once you're satisfied with the execution plan, you can apply the configuration using the terraform apply command. This command tells Terraform to create the infrastructure as defined in your configuration files.

```bash
   terraform apply
```

_Explanation:_

- terraform apply: This command executes the changes described in the execution plan. Terraform will create, modify, or destroy resources as needed to match the desired state defined in your configuration files. You'll be prompted to confirm the changes before Terraform proceeds. You can bypass the prompt by using terraform apply --auto-approve, but this is generally not recommended for production environments.

## Updating Infrastructure with Terraform

Infrastructure is rarely static. Requirements change, and you'll often need to update your infrastructure to reflect those changes. Terraform makes it easy to update your infrastructure in a controlled and predictable manner.

### Modifying Configuration Files

To update your infrastructure, you first need to modify your Terraform configuration files to reflect the desired changes. For example, suppose ExampleCorp wants to increase the instance type of their web server from t2.micro to t2.medium. You would modify the aws_instance resource block in your configuration file:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b24647433a073" # Replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.medium" # Changed instance type
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.web_sg.name]

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleCorp Web Server"
  }
}
```

### Planning the Update

After modifying your configuration files, you need to create a new execution plan to see how Terraform will update your infrastructure. Use the terraform plan command again:

```bash
   terraform plan
```

Terraform will show you that it plans to modify the aws_instance.web_server resource by changing the instance_type attribute.

### Applying the Update

If you're satisfied with the execution plan, you can apply the update using the terraform apply command:

```bash
   terraform apply
```

Terraform will update the EC2 instance to the new instance type. Depending on the resource and the changes being made, Terraform might need to recreate the resource, which could cause downtime. In this case, changing the instance type *will* cause downtime as the instance needs to be stopped and started.

### Handling Dependencies

When updating infrastructure, it's important to consider dependencies between resources. Terraform automatically manages dependencies based on the relationships defined in your configuration files. For example, if you change the security group associated with an EC2 instance, Terraform will update the instance accordingly.

## Destroying Infrastructure with Terraform

When infrastructure is no longer needed, it's important to destroy it to avoid incurring unnecessary costs. Terraform provides a simple and safe way to destroy your infrastructure.

### The terraform destroy Command

The terraform destroy command destroys all the resources managed by your Terraform configuration. Before running this command, make sure you really want to destroy your infrastructure, as this action is irreversible.

```bash
  terraform destroy
```

_Explanation:_

- terraform destroy: This command destroys all the resources managed by your Terraform configuration. It reads the Terraform state file to determine which resources to destroy and then sends the appropriate API calls to the provider to delete those resources. You'll be prompted to confirm the destruction before Terraform proceeds. You can bypass the prompt by using terraform destroy --auto-approve, but this is extremely dangerous and should only be used in automated testing environments.

### Planning the Destruction

Like with apply, you can also plan a destroy operation. This is useful to see what will be destroyed before actually destroying it.

```bash
   terraform plan -destroy
```

### Considerations Before Destroying

- *Data Loss:* Ensure that you have backed up any important data before destroying your infrastructure. Destroying resources like databases or storage volumes will result in permanent data loss.
- *Dependencies:* Be aware of any dependencies that other systems or applications might have on the infrastructure you're about to destroy. Destroying infrastructure that is still in use can cause disruptions or outages.
- *State File:* The terraform destroy command relies on the Terraform state file to know which resources to destroy. If the state file is lost or corrupted, Terraform will not be able to destroy your infrastructure correctly.

### ExampleCorp Scenario

Suppose ExampleCorp is decommissioning a development environment. They would navigate to the Terraform working directory for that environment and run the terraform destroy command. Terraform would then destroy all the resources defined in the configuration files, such as EC2 instances, security groups, and VPCs.

## Exercises

1.  **Create Infrastructure:** Using the example configuration provided, create a web server on AWS. Ensure you replace the placeholder values (AMI ID, VPC ID, region) with appropriate values for your AWS account.
2.  **Update Infrastructure:** Modify the configuration to change the instance type of the web server. Apply the changes and verify that the instance type has been updated in the AWS console.
3.  **Destroy Infrastructure:** Destroy the web server and associated resources. Verify that the resources have been removed from your AWS account.
4.  **Security Group Modification:** Add a rule to the security group to allow SSH traffic (port 22) from your IP address. Apply the changes and then remove the rule.

## Real-World Application

Consider a scenario where a company is using Terraform to manage its cloud infrastructure across multiple environments (development, staging, production). Each environment has its own Terraform configuration files and state file.

- *Creating a New Environment:* When a new environment is needed, the company can simply copy the existing configuration files, modify them as needed, and then run terraform apply to create the new environment.
- *Updating an Existing Environment:* When changes are required in an existing environment, the company modifies the configuration files, runs terraform plan to review the changes, and then runs terraform apply to apply the changes.
- *Decommissioning an Environment:* When an environment is no longer needed, the company runs terraform destroy to remove all the resources associated with that environment.

This approach allows the company to manage its infrastructure in a consistent and repeatable manner, reducing the risk of errors and improving efficiency.

## Summary and Next Steps

In this lesson, you learned how to manage infrastructure with Terraform, including creating, updating, and destroying resources. You saw how to write Terraform configuration files, initialize a Terraform working directory, create execution plans, and apply those plans to create and modify infrastructure. You also learned how to destroy infrastructure when it's no longer needed.

In the next lesson, we will explore Terraform modules, which allow you to organize and reuse your Terraform configurations. Modules are a powerful tool for managing complex infrastructure deployments and promoting code reuse.
