# Writing Your First Terraform Configuration

Terraform allows you to define and manage infrastructure as code. This lesson will guide you through the process of writing your first Terraform configuration file, explaining the core components and syntax involved. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to create a basic configuration that defines a simple infrastructure resource. This is a crucial step towards automating your infrastructure provisioning and management.

## Understanding the Structure of a Terraform Configuration

A Terraform configuration is typically composed of one or more files written in the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). These files define the desired state of your infrastructure. Let's break down the essential elements:

- **Terraform Block:** This block configures Terraform's behavior, including the required providers and their versions.
- **Provider Block:** This block specifies the infrastructure provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) that Terraform will use to manage resources. It also contains provider-specific configuration, such as authentication credentials.
- **Resource Block:** This block defines a specific infrastructure resource, such as a virtual machine, network interface, or storage bucket. It includes the resource type, name, and configuration attributes.

## Writing Your First Configuration File

Let's create a simple Terraform configuration file named main.tf that defines an AWS EC2 instance.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
  }
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b24cd32c1d31d" # Replace with a valid AMI for your region
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "Example Instance"
  }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **terraform block:**

  - required_providers: This section specifies the AWS provider and its version.

    - source = "hashicorp/aws": This indicates that the provider is sourced from the HashiCorp Terraform Registry.
    - version = "~> 4.0": This specifies that Terraform should use a version of the AWS provider that is compatible with version 4.0 (e.g., 4.1, 4.2, but not 5.0).

  - required_version = ">= 1.0": This ensures that Terraform version 1.0 or later is used.

- **provider "aws" block:**

  - region = "us-west-2": This sets the AWS region where the resources will be created. You should replace this with your desired AWS region.

- **resource "aws_instance" "example" block:**

  - resource "aws_instance" "example": This declares a resource of type aws_instance and assigns it the local name example. This local name is used to reference this resource within the Terraform configuration.
  - ami = "ami-0c55b24cd32c1d31d": This specifies the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use for the instance. *Important:* You *must* replace this with a valid AMI ID for the us-west-2 region (or whichever region you specified). You can find suitable AMIs in the AWS Marketplace or by using the AWS CLI.
  - instance_type = "t2.micro": This sets the instance type to t2.micro, which is a small, cost-effective instance type suitable for testing.
  - tags: This block defines tags to apply to the instance. In this case, it sets the Name tag to "Example Instance".

### Important Considerations for AMI IDs

AMI IDs are region-specific. An AMI ID that works in us-west-2 will *not* work in eu-central-1. You *must* find an appropriate AMI for the region you are deploying to. A common practice is to use a data source to dynamically retrieve the correct AMI ID based on the region. This will be covered in a later lesson.

## Terraform Configuration Syntax in Detail

Let's delve deeper into the syntax used in Terraform configuration files.

### Blocks

Blocks are containers for other content. They have a type (e.g., terraform, provider, resource) and can have labels that identify them.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  # Configuration attributes go here
}
```

In this example, resource is the block type, aws_instance is the resource type label, and example is the resource name label.

### Attributes

Attributes are key-value pairs that define the configuration of a block.

```hcl
instance_type = "t2.micro"
```

In this example, instance_type is the attribute key, and "t2.micro" is the value.

### Data Types

Terraform supports several data types:

- **String:** Text enclosed in double quotes (e.g., "hello").
- **Number:** Integer or floating-point numbers (e.g., 10, 3.14).
- **Boolean:** true or false.
- **List:** An ordered collection of values of the same type (e.g., \["a", "b", "c"\]).
- **Map:** A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings and values are of the same type (e.g., { "key1" = "value1", "key2" = "value2" }).
- **Null:** Represents the absence of a value.

### Expressions

Expressions are used to compute values. They can include variables, functions, and operators.

```hcl
instance_type = var.instance_type  # Using a variable
count         = length(var.list)   # Using a function
```

Variables will be covered in a later lesson.

## Initializing Your Terraform Configuration

Before you can use your configuration, you need to initialize it. This downloads the necessary provider plugins and sets up the Terraform working directory.

1.  Navigate to the directory containing your main.tf file in your terminal.
2.  Run the command: terraform init

This command will download the AWS provider plugin and store it in the .terraform directory.

## Applying Your Terraform Configuration

Once the configuration is initialized, you can apply it to create the infrastructure resources.

1.  Run the command: terraform apply

Terraform will display a plan showing the changes it will make to your infrastructure. Review the plan carefully.

1.  Type yes and press Enter to confirm the changes.

Terraform will then create the EC2 instance in your AWS account.

## Verifying the Infrastructure

After Terraform has applied the configuration, you can verify that the EC2 instance has been created.

1.  Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2.  Navigate to the EC2 service.
3.  You should see the "Example Instance" running in the specified region.

## Destroying the Infrastructure

To destroy the infrastructure created by Terraform, run the following command:

```hcl
terraform destroy
```

Terraform will again display a plan showing the resources that will be destroyed.

1.  Type yes and press Enter to confirm the destruction.

Terraform will then terminate the EC2 instance.

## Practice Activities

1.  **Modify the main.tf file to change the instance type to t3.micro.** Apply the configuration and verify the change in the AWS console. Then, destroy the infrastructure.
2.  **Add a second tag to the aws_instance resource.** For example, add a tag with the key "Environment" and the value "Development". Apply the configuration and verify that the tag is added to the instance in the AWS console. Then, destroy the infrastructure.
3.  **Change the AWS region in the provider block to a different region (e.g., us-east-1).** Remember to also update the AMI ID to a valid AMI for the new region. Apply the configuration and verify that the instance is created in the new region. Then, destroy the infrastructure. *Be careful when changing regions, as resource costs and availability may vary.*

## Summary and Next Steps

In this lesson, you learned how to write your first Terraform configuration file, defining an AWS EC2 instance. You explored the core components of a Terraform configuration, including the terraform, provider, and resource blocks. You also learned how to initialize, apply, and destroy your infrastructure using Terraform commands.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to manage infrastructure with Terraform, including updating existing resources and handling dependencies between resources. You will also learn about Terraform state and how it is used to track the current state of your infrastructure.
