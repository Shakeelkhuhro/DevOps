# Introduction to Ansible Roles

Ansible Roles are a crucial organizational tool in Ansible, allowing you to bundle related configuration tasks, variables, handlers, and other components into a reusable structure. This promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability in your Ansible playbooks, especially as your infrastructure grows in complexity. Without roles, playbooks can become unwieldy and difficult to manage. This lesson will delve into the structure of Ansible Roles, how to create them, and how to use them effectively in your playbooks.

## Understanding Ansible Roles

An Ansible Role is essentially a directory structure with predefined subdirectories, each serving a specific purpose. This structure allows you to organize your Ansible content in a logical and reusable way. Think of it as a self-contained unit of configuration that can be easily applied to different hosts or groups of hosts.

### Key Components of an Ansible Role

An Ansible Role typically contains the following directories:

- tasks/: This directory contains the main list of tasks to be executed by the role. The main task file is usually named main.yml.
- handlers/: This directory contains handlers, which are special tasks that are only executed when notified by other tasks. The main handler file is usually named main.yml.
- vars/: This directory contains variables that are used by the role. The main variable file is usually named main.yml.
- defaults/: This directory contains default variables for the role. These variables have the lowest precedence and can be overridden by variables defined in other places. The main default variable file is usually named main.yml.
- meta/: This directory contains metadata about the role, such as the author, description, and dependencies. The main metadata file is usually named main.yml.
- files/: This directory contains files that can be copied to the managed hosts.
- templates/: This directory contains Jinja2 templates that can be rendered and copied to the managed hosts.

### Benefits of Using Ansible Roles

- **Modularity:** Roles break down complex configurations into smaller, manageable units.
- **Reusability:** Roles can be easily reused across multiple playbooks and projects.
- **Maintainability:** Changes to a role only need to be made in one place, making it easier to maintain your infrastructure configuration.
- **Collaboration:** Roles facilitate collaboration by allowing different team members to work on different parts of the infrastructure configuration independently.
- **Organization:** Roles enforce a consistent directory structure, making it easier to find and understand the configuration.

## Creating Your First Ansible Role

There are two primary ways to create an Ansible Role: manually creating the directory structure or using the ansible-galaxy command-line tool. We'll focus on using ansible-galaxy as it's the recommended and more efficient approach.

### Using ansible-galaxy

ansible-galaxy is a command-line tool that comes with Ansible and is used for managing roles. To create a new role, use the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy init <role_name>
```

For example, to create a role named webserver, you would run:

```bash
ansible-galaxy init webserver
```

This command will create a directory named webserver with the standard role directory structure.

### Examining the Role Directory Structure

After running the ansible-galaxy init command, you'll have a directory structure that looks like this:

```plaintext
webserver/
├── defaults
│   └── main.yml
├── files
├── handlers
│   └── main.yml
├── meta
│   └── main.yml
├── README.md
├── tasks
│   └── main.yml
├── templates
├── tests
│   ├── inventory
│   └── test.yml
└── vars
    └── main.yml
```

Let's examine each of these directories and files in more detail:

*   defaults/main.yml: This file is used to define default variables for the role. These variables have the lowest precedence and can be overridden by variables defined in other places, such as in the playbook or in the inventory.
    
*   files/: This directory is used to store static files that you want to copy to the managed hosts. For example, you might store configuration files or scripts in this directory.
    
*   handlers/main.yml: This file is used to define handlers, which are special tasks that are only executed when notified by other tasks. Handlers are typically used to restart services or perform other actions that should only be performed when a configuration change has been made.
    
*   meta/main.yml: This file is used to define metadata about the role, such as the author, description, and dependencies. This information is used by Ansible Galaxy, a repository for sharing Ansible roles.
    
*   README.md: This file is used to document the role. It should include information about what the role does, how to use it, and any dependencies it has.
    
*   tasks/main.yml: This file is the main entry point for the role. It contains the list of tasks that will be executed when the role is included in a playbook.
    
*   templates/: This directory is used to store Jinja2 templates that you want to render and copy to the managed hosts. Templates are used to generate configuration files dynamically based on variables.
    
*   tests/inventory: This file is used to define the inventory for testing the role.
    
*   tests/test.yml: This file is used to define the tests for the role.
    
*   vars/main.yml: This file is used to define variables that are used by the role. These variables have a higher precedence than the default variables defined in defaults/main.yml.
    

Using Ansible Roles in Playbooks
--------------------------------

To use a role in a playbook, you use the roles keyword. Here's an example:

```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  roles:
    - webserver
```

This playbook will apply the webserver role to all hosts in the webservers group.

### Passing Variables to Roles
You can pass variables to roles in several ways:

* **In the playbook:**
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: webserver
      webserver_port: 8080
```

* **In the inventory file:**
```ini
[webservers]
server1 webserver_port=8080
server2 webserver_port=8081
```

* **In the vars/main.yml file of the role:** This is generally used for variables that are specific to the role and are not likely to be changed.

* **In the defaults/main.yml file of the role:** This is used for default values that can be overridden.

### Role Dependencies
Roles can depend on other roles. This allows you to build complex configurations by composing smaller, reusable roles. To define role dependencies, you use the dependencies keyword in the meta/main.yml file of the role.
```yaml
---
dependencies:
  - role: common
  - role: database
    when: install_database
```

In this example, the webserver role depends on the common and database roles. The database role is only installed when the install\_database variable is set to true.

Practical Examples
------------------

Let's consider a few practical examples of how Ansible Roles can be used:

### Example 1: Installing and Configuring a Web Server

Imagine you need to install and configure a web server (e.g., Apache or Nginx) on multiple servers. You can create a webserver role that handles the following tasks:

1.  Install the web server package.
    
2.  Configure the web server (e.g., set the listening port, configure virtual hosts).
    
3.  Start the web server service.
    
4.  Deploy a default website.
    

The tasks/main.yml file of the webserver role might look like this:
```yaml
---
---
- name: Install web server package
  package:
    name: "{{ webserver_package }}"
    state: present

- name: Configure web server
  template:
    src: templates/webserver.conf.j2
    dest: "{{ webserver_config_file }}"
  notify: restart webserver

- name: Start web server service
  service:
    name: "{{ webserver_service }}"
    state: started
    enabled: true
```

The handlers/main.yml file might look like this:

```yaml
---
- name: restart webserver
  service:
    name: "{{ webserver_service }}"
    state: restarted
```

The vars/main.yml file might look like this:

```yaml
---
webserver_package: apache2
webserver_config_file: /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
webserver_service: apache2
```

### Example 2: Installing and Configuring a Database Server

Similarly, you can create a database role to install and configure a database server (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL). This role might handle the following tasks:

1.  Install the database server package.
    
2.  Configure the database server (e.g., set the root password, create databases and users).
    
3.  Start the database server service.
    

### Example 3: Applying Common Security Settings

A security role could be created to apply common security settings across all servers, such as:

1.  Installing and configuring a firewall.
    
2.  Setting up intrusion detection systems.
    
3.  Configuring SSH hardening.
    

Hypothetical Scenario: Streamlining Application Deployment at ExampleCorp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's revisit ExampleCorp. They are struggling with inconsistent application deployments across their development, testing, and production environments. They decide to implement Ansible Roles to standardize the deployment process.

They create roles for:

*   application\_deploy: Handles the deployment of the application code.
    
*   database\_setup: Configures the database connection.
    
*   load\_balancer: Configures the load balancer to route traffic to the application servers.
    

By using these roles, ExampleCorp can ensure that the application is deployed consistently across all environments, reducing errors and improving the overall deployment process. They can also easily update the deployment process by modifying the roles, and the changes will be automatically applied to all environments.

Exercises
---------

1.  Create an Ansible Role named ntp that installs and configures the NTP client on a managed host. The role should:
    
    *   Install the ntp package.
        
    *   Ensure the ntpd service is running and enabled.
        
    *   Allow the user to specify a list of NTP servers via a variable.
        
2.  Modify the webserver role example to support both Apache and Nginx. Use variables to determine which web server to install and configure.
    
3.  Create a common role that includes tasks that are common to all servers, such as setting the timezone and configuring the hostname. Then, make the webserver and database roles depend on the common role.
    
4.  Research and implement a role from Ansible Galaxy. For example, find a role that installs and configures a specific monitoring tool.
