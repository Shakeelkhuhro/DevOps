Writing Your First Ansible Playbook
===================================

Ansible playbooks are the heart of Ansible's automation capabilities. They are human-readable, YAML-formatted files that describe the desired state of your systems. This lesson will guide you through the process of writing your first Ansible playbook, covering the essential components and best practices for effective configuration management. We'll build upon the foundational knowledge of Ansible architecture and installation covered in previous lessons, and prepare you for managing servers with Ansible in the next lesson.

Understanding Ansible Playbooks
-------------------------------

An Ansible playbook is a file containing one or more _plays_. A play defines a set of tasks to be executed on a specific group of hosts. Playbooks are written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language), a human-readable data serialization format.

### Key Components of a Playbook

A basic Ansible playbook consists of the following components:

*   **Hosts:** Specifies the target hosts or groups of hosts where the tasks will be executed.
    
*   **Tasks:** A list of actions to be performed on the target hosts. Each task typically involves executing an Ansible module.
    
*   **Variables (Optional):** Defines variables that can be used within the playbook to make it more flexible and reusable.
    

### YAML Fundamentals for Ansible

YAML uses indentation to define the structure of the data. Key-value pairs are represented using a colon (:) and a space. Lists are represented using a hyphen (-).

_Example:_
```yaml
---
key: value
list_item:
  - item1
  - item2
```

### ExampleCorp Scenario

Let's continue with our ExampleCorp scenario. Imagine we need to ensure that all web servers in ExampleCorp have the nginx web server installed and running. We can create an Ansible playbook to automate this task.

Writing Your First Playbook: Installing Nginx
---------------------------------------------

Let's create a playbook named install\_nginx.yml to install and start Nginx on our web servers.

### Playbook Structure
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

_Explanation:_

*   \---: Indicates the start of a YAML document.
    
*   \- hosts: webservers: Specifies that this play will target the webservers group defined in your Ansible inventory file (covered in the previous lesson).
    
*   become: true: Instructs Ansible to execute the tasks with elevated privileges (using sudo).
    
*   tasks:: A list of tasks to be executed.
    
*   name: Install Nginx: A descriptive name for the task.
    
*   apt:: Uses the apt module to manage packages on Debian/Ubuntu systems.
    
    *   name: nginx: Specifies the package to install.
        
    *   state: present: Ensures that the package is installed.
        
*   name: Start Nginx: A descriptive name for the task.
    
*   service:: Uses the service module to manage services.
    
    *   name: nginx: Specifies the service to manage.
        
    *   state: started: Ensures that the service is running.
        
    *   enabled: true: Ensures that the service starts automatically on boot.
        

### Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, use the ansible-playbook command:
```bash
ansible-playbook install_nginx.yml
```

Ansible will connect to the hosts in the webservers group and execute the tasks defined in the playbook. The output will show the status of each task, indicating whether it was successful, changed the system, or failed.

### Handling Different Operating Systems

The previous playbook uses the apt module, which is specific to Debian/Ubuntu systems. To make the playbook more portable, we can use variables and conditional statements to handle different operating systems.
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  vars:
    pkg_name: nginx
    service_name: nginx
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx (Debian/Ubuntu)
      apt:
        name: "{{ pkg_name }}"
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install Nginx (RedHat/CentOS)
      yum:
        name: "{{ pkg_name }}"
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Start Nginx
      service:
        name: "{{ service_name }}"
        state: started
        enabled: true
```

_Explanation:_

*   vars:: Defines variables that can be used within the playbook.
    
    *   pkg\_name: nginx: Defines a variable named pkg\_name with the value nginx.
        
    *   service\_name: nginx: Defines a variable named service\_name with the value nginx.
        
*   {{ pkg\_name }}: Uses Jinja2 templating to access the value of the pkg\_name variable.
    
*   when: ansible\_os\_family == "Debian": A conditional statement that only executes the task if the ansible\_os\_family fact is equal to "Debian". ansible\_os\_family is a _fact_ gathered by Ansible about the target host. Ansible facts were introduced in the "Understanding Ansible Architecture" lesson.
    
*   yum:: Uses the yum module to manage packages on RedHat/CentOS systems.
    
*   when: ansible\_os\_family == "RedHat": A conditional statement that only executes the task if the ansible\_os\_family fact is equal to "RedHat".
    

This playbook now uses the ansible\_os\_family fact to determine which package manager to use based on the operating system of the target host.

More Complex Playbooks: Deploying a Web Application
---------------------------------------------------

Let's extend our ExampleCorp scenario. Suppose we need to deploy a simple web application to our web servers. This involves copying the application files to the server and configuring the web server to serve the application.

### Playbook Structure
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true
  vars:
    app_name: myapp
    app_dir: /var/www/{{ app_name }}
    template_file: nginx.conf.j2
  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx (Debian/Ubuntu)
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Install Nginx (RedHat/CentOS)
      yum:
        name: nginx
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"

    - name: Create application directory
      file:
        path: "{{ app_dir }}"
        state: directory
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data

    - name: Copy application files
      copy:
        src: files/{{ app_name }}
        dest: "{{ app_dir }}"
        owner: www-data
        group: www-data

    - name: Deploy Nginx configuration
      template:
        src: templates/{{ template_file }}
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ app_name }}
      notify:
        - restart nginx

    - name: Enable site
      file:
        src: /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ app_name }}
        dest: /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/{{ app_name }}
        state: link
      notify:
        - restart nginx

  handlers:
    - name: restart nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
```

_Explanation:_

*   app\_name: myapp: Defines a variable named app\_name with the value myapp.
    
*   app\_dir: /var/www/{{ app\_name }}: Defines a variable named app\_dir with the value /var/www/myapp.
    
*   template\_file: nginx.conf.j2: Defines a variable named template\_file with the value nginx.conf.j2.
    
*   file:: Uses the file module to manage files and directories.
    
    *   state: directory: Ensures that the directory exists.
        
    *   owner: www-data: Sets the owner of the directory to www-data.
        
    *   group: www-data: Sets the group of the directory to www-data.
        
*   copy:: Uses the copy module to copy files from the Ansible control node to the target host.
    
    *   src: files/{{ app\_name }}: Specifies the source directory on the Ansible control node. This assumes you have a directory named files in the same directory as your playbook, and that files contains a subdirectory named myapp with your application files.
        
    *   dest: "{{ app\_dir }}": Specifies the destination directory on the target host.
        
*   template:: Uses the template module to deploy configuration files from Jinja2 templates.
    
    *   src: templates/{{ template\_file }}: Specifies the source template file on the Ansible control node. This assumes you have a directory named templates in the same directory as your playbook, and that templates contains a file named nginx.conf.j2.
        
    *   dest: /etc/nginx/sites-available/{{ app\_name }}: Specifies the destination file on the target host.
        
    *   notify:: Specifies a handler to be triggered when the task changes the system.
        
*   state: link: Creates a symbolic link.
    
*   handlers:: A list of handlers to be executed when notified by a task.
    
    *   name: restart nginx: A descriptive name for the handler.
        
    *   service:: Uses the service module to manage services.
        
        *   state: restarted: Restarts the service.
            

### Jinja2 Templates

The template module uses Jinja2 templating to generate configuration files dynamically. Jinja2 allows you to embed variables and logic within your configuration files.

_Example nginx.conf.j2:_
```jinja2
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;
    root {{ app_dir }};

    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

_Explanation:_

*   {{ app\_dir }}: A Jinja2 variable that will be replaced with the value of the app\_dir variable defined in the playbook.
    

### Directory Structure

To use the above playbook, you need to create the following directory structure on your Ansible control node:
```
├── install_app.yml
├── files
│   └── myapp
│       └── index.html
└── templates
    └── nginx.conf.j2
```

_Explanation:_

*   install\_app.yml: The Ansible playbook.
    
*   files/myapp/index.html: The application files.
    
*   templates/nginx.conf.j2: The Nginx configuration template.
    

### Running the Playbook

To run the playbook, use the ansible-playbook command:
```bash
ansible-playbook install_app.yml
```

Ansible will connect to the hosts in the webservers group, create the application directory, copy the application files, deploy the Nginx configuration, enable the site, and restart Nginx.

Best Practices for Writing Playbooks
------------------------------------

*   **Keep Playbooks Modular:** Break down complex tasks into smaller, reusable plays. This improves readability and maintainability.
    
*   **Use Variables:** Use variables to make your playbooks more flexible and reusable.
    
*   **Use Handlers:** Use handlers to restart services or perform other actions only when necessary.
    
*   **Write Idempotent Tasks:** Ensure that your tasks only make changes when necessary. This prevents unnecessary restarts and ensures that your systems are in the desired state.
    
*   **Use Comments:** Add comments to your playbooks to explain what each task does.
    
*   **Test Your Playbooks:** Test your playbooks in a development environment before deploying them to production.
    

Exercises
---------

1.  Modify the install\_nginx.yml playbook to also configure a custom welcome page for Nginx.
    
2.  Create a playbook to install and configure a firewall (e.g., ufw on Ubuntu) on your servers.
    
3.  Extend the web application deployment playbook to also configure a database server (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
    
4.  Create a playbook that updates all packages on your servers.
