Managing Servers with Ansible: Basic Tasks
==========================================

Ansible is a powerful tool for automating IT tasks, and this lesson will equip you with the fundamental skills to manage servers effectively. We'll explore essential tasks like managing packages, users, services, and files, providing you with a solid foundation for more advanced automation scenarios. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to write playbooks that handle common server administration tasks, ensuring consistency and efficiency in your infrastructure management.

Core Ansible Modules for Basic Server Management
------------------------------------------------

Ansible modules are the building blocks of playbooks. They represent specific actions that Ansible can perform on managed nodes. Here, we'll focus on modules essential for basic server management.

### Package Management: The package Module

The package module is used to manage software packages on managed nodes. It supports various package managers like apt, yum, dnf, and homebrew, automatically detecting the appropriate one based on the operating system.

*   **Installing a Package:**
```yaml
- name: Install the 'tree' package
  package:
    name: tree
    state: present # Ensures the package is installed
```

In this example, name: tree specifies the package to install, and state: present ensures that the package is installed. If the package is already installed, Ansible will not take any action.

*   **Removing a Package:**
```yaml
- name: Remove the 'tree' package
  package:
    name: tree
    state: absent # Ensures the package is removed
```

Here, state: absent ensures that the package is removed. If the package is not installed, Ansible will not take any action.

* **Updating a Package:**
```yaml
- name: Update the 'tree' package to the latest version
  package:
    name: tree
    state: latest # Ensures the package is the latest version
```

**state:** latest ensures that the package is updated to the latest available version.

* **Specific Version Installation:**
```yaml
- name: Install a specific version of nginx
  package:
    name: nginx=1.18.0 # Specify the version
    state: present
```

This installs version 1.18.0 of the nginx package.

### User Management: The user Module

The user module is used to manage user accounts on managed nodes. You can create, modify, and delete user accounts, as well as manage their attributes like UID, GID, and home directory.

*   **Creating a User:**
```yaml
- name: Create a new user 'deploy'
  user:
    name: deploy
    comment: Deploy User
    uid: 1001
    group: wheel
    home: /home/deploy
    shell: /bin/bash
    password: "$6$rounds=656000$salt$hashed_password_here" # Use ansible-vault for real passwords
    createhome: yes
```

This example creates a user named deploy with a comment, UID, primary group, home directory, shell, and password. createhome: yes ensures that the home directory is created. Important: Never store passwords directly in playbooks. Use ansible-vault to encrypt sensitive information.

* **Removing a User:**
```yaml
- name: Remove the user 'deploy'
  user:
    name: deploy
    state: absent # Ensures the user is removed
    remove: yes # Removes the user's home directory
```

state: absent ensures that the user is removed. remove: yes also removes the user's home directory.

*   **Modifying a User:**
```yaml
- name: Modify the user 'deploy'
  user:
    name: deploy
    comment: "New Deploy User"
    groups: "docker" # Add user to the docker group
    append: yes # Append the group instead of replacing
```

This example modifies the deploy user's comment and adds them to the docker group. append: yes ensures that the user is added to the group without removing them from other groups.

### Service Management: The service Module

The service module is used to manage services on managed nodes. You can start, stop, restart, and reload services, as well as ensure that they are enabled to start on boot.

*   **Starting a Service:**
```yaml
- name: Start the 'nginx' service
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: started # Ensures the service is started
```

This example starts the nginx service. If the service is already running, Ansible will not take any action.


*   **Stopping a Service:**
```yaml
- name: Stop the 'nginx' service
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: stopped # Ensures the service is stopped
```

This example stops the nginx service. If the service is already stopped, Ansible will not take any action.

*   **Restarting a Service:**
```yaml
- name: Restart the 'nginx' service
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: restarted # Restarts the service
```

This example restarts the nginx service.

*   **Enabling a Service:**
```yaml
- name: Ensure the 'nginx' service is enabled on boot
  service:
    name: nginx
    enabled: yes # Ensures the service starts on boot
```

*enabled: yes* ensures that the service is enabled to start on boot.

*   **Reloading a Service:**
```yaml
- name: Reload the 'nginx' service
  service:
    name: nginx
    state: reloaded
```

This example reloads the nginx service. Reloading is often preferable to restarting, as it typically avoids downtime.

### File Management: The file Module

The file module is used to manage files and directories on managed nodes. You can create, modify, and delete files and directories, as well as change their permissions and ownership.
```yaml
- name: Create a directory '/opt/app'
  file:
    path: /opt/app
    state: directory # Ensures the path is a directory
    owner: deploy
    group: deploy
    mode: '0755'
```

This example creates a directory named /opt/app with the specified owner, group, and permissions. state: directory ensures that the path is a directory.

*   **Creating a File:**
```yaml
- name: Create an empty file '/opt/app/config.txt'
  file:
    path: /opt/app/config.txt
    state: touch # Ensures the file exists
    owner: deploy
    group: deploy
    mode: '0644'
```

This example creates an empty file named /opt/app/config.txt with the specified owner, group, and permissions. state: touch ensures that the file exists.

*   **Deleting a File or Directory:**
```yaml
- name: Remove the file '/opt/app/config.txt'
  file:
    path: /opt/app/config.txt
    state: absent # Ensures the file is removed
```

This example removes the file /opt/app/config.txt. state: absent ensures that the file is removed.

*   **Changing File Permissions:**
```yaml
- name: Change file permissions on '/opt/app/config.txt'
  file:
    path: /opt/app/config.txt
    mode: '0600'
```

This example changes the permissions of the file /opt/app/config.txt to 0600, allowing only the owner to read and write.

*   **Changing Ownership:**
```yaml
- name: Change file ownership on '/opt/app/config.txt'
  file:
    path: /opt/app/config.txt
    owner: root
    group: root
```

This example changes the owner and group of the file /opt/app/config.txt to root.

Practical Examples and Demonstrations
-------------------------------------

Let's combine these modules into practical playbooks to demonstrate common server management tasks.

### Example 1: Setting up a Basic Web Server

This playbook installs Nginx, creates a user for deployment, and sets up a basic directory structure.
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true # Required for privileged operations

  tasks:
    - name: Install Nginx
      package:
        name: nginx
        state: present

    - name: Create deploy user
      user:
        name: deploy
        comment: Deploy User
        home: /home/deploy
        shell: /bin/bash
        createhome: yes

    - name: Create web application directory
      file:
        path: /var/www/app
        state: directory
        owner: deploy
        group: deploy
        mode: '0755'

    - name: Ensure Nginx is running and enabled
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```
This playbook first installs Nginx using the package module. Then, it creates a deploy user with a home directory. It creates a directory for the web application and finally ensures that the Nginx service is running and enabled on boot.

### Example 2: Managing a Configuration File
This playbook creates a configuration file and restarts a service if the file changes. We'll use the template module (which will be covered in more detail in the next lesson) to create the configuration file from a Jinja2 template.
```yaml
---
- hosts: webservers
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Deploy application configuration
      template:
        src: templates/app.conf.j2 # Path to the Jinja2 template
        dest: /etc/app/app.conf
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644'
      notify: restart_app # Trigger the handler

  handlers:
    - name: restart_app
      service:
        name: myapp
        state: restarted
```

This playbook deploys a configuration file from a Jinja2 template to /etc/app/app.conf. If the template changes, it triggers the restart_app handler, which restarts the myapp service. Handlers are special tasks that only run when notified by another task. The template module will be covered in detail in the next lesson.

### Example 3: Updating Packages and Removing Unnecessary Software
This playbook updates all packages on the system and removes a specific package.
```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true

  tasks:
    - name: Update all packages
      package:
        name: "*" # Update all packages
        state: latest

    - name: Remove legacy software
      package:
        name: telnet
        state: absent
```

This playbook updates all packages to their latest versions and then removes the telnet package.

Exercises and Practice Activities
---------------------------------

1.  **Create a playbook to install Apache, create a 'webadmin' user, and create a basic HTML file in the web root directory.** Set appropriate permissions for the user and the web root directory. Ensure Apache is running and enabled on boot.
    
2.  **Write a playbook that stops the firewalld service, disables it on boot, and then installs and starts the ufw firewall.** Enable ufw on boot.
    
3.  **Develop a playbook that creates a directory /var/log/myapp, sets the owner to 'myappuser', and then creates a logrotate configuration file to rotate the logs in that directory.** You can use the template module (covered in the next lesson) to create the logrotate configuration file.
    
4.  **Create a playbook that adds a new user, installs sudo, and then adds the new user to the sudo group.**
