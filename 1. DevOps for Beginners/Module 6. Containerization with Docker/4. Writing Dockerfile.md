# Writing Your First Dockerfile

The Dockerfile is the foundation of creating Docker images. It's a simple text file containing instructions that Docker uses to automatically build an image. Think of it as a recipe for creating a container. This lesson will guide you through writing your first Dockerfile, understanding its syntax, and learning how to use common instructions. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to create Dockerfiles that define the environment for your applications, setting the stage for building and running containers in the subsequent lessons.

## Understanding the Dockerfile Structure

A Dockerfile is a plain text file that contains a series of instructions, each representing a layer in the final Docker image. Docker reads these instructions sequentially and executes them to build the image. Each instruction adds a new layer to the image, and these layers are cached to speed up subsequent builds.

## Basic Syntax

Each instruction in a Dockerfile generally follows this format:

```
INSTRUCTION argument
```

**INSTRUCTION**: This is the command you want Docker to execute (e.g., FROM, RUN, COPY, CMD). Instructions are case-insensitive but are conventionally written in uppercase to distinguish them from arguments.
**argument**: This provides the necessary information for the instruction to execute. The argument can be a file path, a command, or any other data required by the instruction.

## Essential Dockerfile Instructions

Here's a breakdown of some of the most commonly used Dockerfile instructions:

### FROM

This is the base image for your new image. It's the starting point of your Dockerfile. You can use official images from Docker Hub (e.g., ubuntu, python, node) or create your own base image.

**Example:**

```
FROM ubuntu:20.04
```

This line specifies that the new image will be based on the Ubuntu 20.04 image from Docker Hub.

### RUN

This instruction executes commands inside the container during the image build process. It's used to install software, create directories, and perform other setup tasks.

**Example:**

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 python3-pip
```

This line updates the package list and installs Python 3 and pip (Python package installer) inside the container. The --no-install-recommends flag is used to avoid installing unnecessary dependencies, keeping the image size smaller.

### COPY

This instruction copies files and directories from your host machine into the container's file system.

**Example:**

```
COPY . /app
```

This line copies all files and directories from the current directory (where the Dockerfile is located) to the /app directory inside the container.

### ADD

Similar to COPY, but ADD has some additional features, such as automatically extracting compressed files and fetching files from URLs. However, COPY is generally preferred because it's more explicit and predictable.

**Example:**

```
ADD myapp.tar.gz /app/
```

This line extracts the myapp.tar.gz archive into the /app/ directory inside the container.

### WORKDIR

This instruction sets the working directory for subsequent instructions like RUN, CMD, COPY, and ADD.

**Example:**

```
WORKDIR /app
```

This line sets the working directory to /app. Any commands executed after this line will be executed from within the /app directory.

### EXPOSE

This instruction declares which ports the container will listen on at runtime. It doesn't actually publish the port, but it serves as documentation and can be used by linking containers.

**Example:**

```
EXPOSE 8080
```

This line indicates that the container will listen on port 8080.

### CMD

This instruction specifies the command to run when the container starts. There can only be one CMD instruction in a Dockerfile. If you specify more than one, only the last one will take effect.

**Example:**

```
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
```

This line specifies that the app.py script should be executed using python3 when the container starts. The CMD instruction can be overridden when running the container using the docker run command.

### ENTRYPOINT

Similar to CMD, but ENTRYPOINT defines the main executable for the container. Unlike CMD, ENTRYPOINT is not easily overridden. It's often used to create executable images.

**Example:**

```
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/gunicorn", "--config", "/app/gunicorn_config.py", "app:app"]
```

This line sets the entry point to the Gunicorn WSGI server, which will serve the Python application.

### ENV

This instruction sets environment variables inside the container.

**Example:**

```
ENV APP_HOME /app
```

This line sets the environment variable APP\_HOME to /app. These variables can be accessed by the application running inside the container.

### USER

This instruction sets the user to use when running subsequent commands.

**Example:**

```
USER myuser
```

This line switches the user to myuser for subsequent commands. It's good practice to avoid running containers as root for security reasons.

## Dockerignore File

A .dockerignore file is used to exclude files and directories from being copied into the Docker image during the build process. This can significantly reduce the image size and build time. The syntax is similar to that of a .gitignore file.

**Example:**

```
node_modules
.git
*.log
```

This .dockerignore file excludes the node\_modules directory, the .git directory, and all files with the .log extension from being included in the Docker image.

## Writing a Simple Dockerfile: A Python Example

Let's create a simple Dockerfile for a Python application. Assume you have a file named app.py with the following content:

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

This is a basic Flask application that displays "Hello, World!" in the browser. You'll also need a requirements.txt file that lists the Python dependencies:

```
# requirements.txt
Flask
```

Here's the Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory to /app
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements file into the container at /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code into the container
COPY app.py .

# Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### Explanation:

* **FROM python:3.9-slim-buster**: Specifies the base image as Python 3.9 based on Debian Buster. The slim variant is smaller than the full image.
* **WORKDIR /app**: Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.
* **COPY requirements.txt .**: Copies the requirements.txt file from the host to the /app directory in the container.
* **RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt**: Installs the Python dependencies listed in requirements.txt. The --no-cache-dir option prevents pip from caching downloaded packages, reducing the image size.
* **COPY app.py .**: Copies the app.py file from the host to the /app directory in the container.
* **EXPOSE 80**: Exposes port 80, which the Flask application will listen on.
* **CMD \["python", "app.py"]**: Specifies the command to run when the container starts, which is to execute the app.py script using Python.

## Building and Running the Docker Image

* **Save the Dockerfile**: Save the above content in a file named Dockerfile (without any file extension) in the same directory as app.py and requirements.txt.

* **Build the image**: Open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile, and run the following command:

```
docker build -t my-python-app .
```

* `docker build`: The command to build a Docker image.

* `-t my-python-app`: Tags the image with the name my-python-app. This makes it easier to refer to the image later.

* `.`: Specifies the build context, which is the current directory. Docker will look for the Dockerfile in this directory.

* **Run the container**: After the image is built successfully, run the following command to start a container from the image:

```
docker run -d -p 8000:80 my-python-app
```

* `docker run`: The command to run a container.

* `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).

* `-p 8000:80`: Maps port 8000 on the host machine to port 80 on the container. This allows you to access the application in your browser.

* `my-python-app`: Specifies the image to use for creating the container.

* **Access the application**: Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You should see the "Hello, World!" message.

## Best Practices for Writing Dockerfiles

* **Use a specific base image**: Avoid using generic base images like latest. Instead, specify a specific version to ensure consistency and avoid unexpected changes. For example, use python:3.9-slim-buster instead of just python.
* **Minimize the number of layers**: Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image. Reducing the number of layers can improve build time and reduce image size. You can combine multiple commands into a single RUN instruction using &&.
* **Use multi-stage builds**: Multi-stage builds allow you to use multiple FROM instructions in a single Dockerfile. This can be useful for separating the build environment from the runtime environment, resulting in smaller and more secure images.
* **Sort multi-line arguments**: Sorting multi-line arguments alphabetically can improve readability and reduce the risk of conflicts.
* **Leverage the cache**: Docker caches the layers of an image during the build process. If a layer hasn't changed, Docker will reuse the cached layer, speeding up the build. Place instructions that change frequently (like copying application code) towards the end of the Dockerfile.
* **Use .dockerignore**: Always use a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files and directories from being copied into the image. This can significantly reduce the image size and build time.
* **Avoid installing unnecessary packages**: Only install the packages that are strictly required for your application to run. This will keep the image size smaller and improve security.
* **Run containers as a non-root user**: Avoid running containers as the root user for security reasons. Create a dedicated user and group for your application and switch to that user using the USER instruction.

## Advanced Dockerfile Concepts

### Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds are a powerful feature that allows you to use multiple FROM statements in a single Dockerfile. This is useful for creating smaller and more efficient images by separating the build environment from the runtime environment.

**Example:**

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application
FROM maven:3.8.1-openjdk-11 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Create the runtime image
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

In this example, the first stage (builder) uses a Maven image to build a Java application. The second stage uses a smaller JRE image and copies only the built JAR file from the first stage. This results in a much smaller final image.

### Healthchecks

Healthchecks allow Docker to monitor the health of your application running inside the container. You can define a healthcheck in your Dockerfile using the HEALTHCHECK instruction.

**Example:**

```dockerfile
HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/ || exit 1
```

This healthcheck runs a curl command every 5 minutes to check if the application is responding on port 8080. If the command fails (returns a non-zero exit code) or times out after 3 seconds, Docker considers the container unhealthy.

## Using Variables

You can use environment variables in your Dockerfile to make it more flexible and configurable. You can define variables using the ARG or ENV instructions.

### ARG

Defines a variable that can be passed during the build process using the --build-arg flag.

**Example:**

```dockerfile
ARG VERSION=1.0
RUN echo "Application version: $VERSION"
```

You can build the image with a specific version using:

```
docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.0 -t my-app .
```

### ENV

Defines a variable that is set in the container's environment at runtime.

**Example:**

```dockerfile
ENV APP_HOME /app
WORKDIR $APP_HOME
```

## ExampleCorp Dockerfile Strategy

Let's consider how ExampleCorp might use Dockerfiles for their applications. Recall from previous modules that ExampleCorp is migrating their monolithic application to a microservices architecture.

For each microservice, ExampleCorp will create a dedicated Dockerfile. For example, the "User Authentication" service might have a Dockerfile like this:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "auth_service.py"]
```

This Dockerfile would be placed in the root directory of the "User Authentication" service's code repository. ExampleCorp's CI/CD pipeline (which we'll cover in later modules) would then use this Dockerfile to build and deploy the service.

ExampleCorp would also use a .dockerignore file to exclude unnecessary files from the image, such as development tools, test data, and documentation. This helps to keep the image size small and improve security.

**.dockerignore**

```
*.pyc
*.log
tests/
docs/
```

By using Dockerfiles consistently across all their microservices, ExampleCorp can ensure that each service has a consistent and reproducible environment, simplifying deployment and management.
