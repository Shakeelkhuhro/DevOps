## Building and Running Docker Images

This lesson delves into the practical aspects of creating and executing Docker images, the foundational building blocks of containerized applications. We'll explore the process of defining an application's environment and dependencies within a Dockerfile, constructing images from these files, and finally, running those images as isolated containers. This is a crucial step in understanding how to package and deploy applications consistently across different environments, a core principle of DevOps.

### Understanding the Docker Build Process

The Docker build process transforms a Dockerfile into a Docker image. This process involves several key steps:

* **Dockerfile Creation**: A Dockerfile is a text file containing a series of instructions that Docker uses to assemble an image. Each instruction adds a new layer to the image.
* **Image Building**: The `docker build` command reads the Dockerfile and executes the instructions sequentially. Each instruction results in a new layer in the image.
* **Layer Caching**: Docker caches each layer during the build process. If a layer hasn't changed since the last build, Docker reuses the cached layer, significantly speeding up the build process.
* **Image Tagging**: After the image is built, it's tagged with a name and optionally a version. This tag is used to identify and reference the image later.

### Dockerfile Instructions in Detail

Dockerfile instructions are the commands that define the contents and configuration of a Docker image. Here's a breakdown of some of the most commonly used instructions:

* **FROM**: Specifies the base image to use as a starting point.
  `FROM ubuntu:20.04`

* **MAINTAINER (Deprecated)**: Specifies the author of the image.
  `MAINTAINER John Doe <john.doe@example.com>`

* **LABEL**: Adds metadata to the image in the form of key-value pairs.
  `LABEL author="John Doe" version="1.0" description="My custom image"`

* **RUN**: Executes commands inside the container during the build process.
  `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx`

* **COPY**: Copies files and directories from the host machine into the image.
  `COPY ./app /var/www/html`

* **ADD**: Like COPY, but can also extract compressed files and fetch from URLs.
  `ADD ./app.tar.gz /var/www/html`

* **WORKDIR**: Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions.
  `WORKDIR /var/www/html`

* **EXPOSE**: Declares the ports that the container will listen on at runtime.
  `EXPOSE 80`

* **ENV**: Sets environment variables inside the container.
  `ENV APP_HOME /var/www/html`

* **CMD**: Specifies the command to run when the container starts.
  `CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]`

* **ENTRYPOINT**: Configures the container to run as an executable.
  `ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh"]`

* **USER**: Sets the user to run subsequent commands as.
  `USER www-data`

* **VOLUME**: Creates a mount point for persistent storage.
  `VOLUME /var/lib/mysql`

* **ARG**: Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time.
  `ARG VERSION=1.0`

* **ONBUILD**: Specifies commands executed when the image is used as a base.
  `ONBUILD RUN echo "This will run when someone builds an image FROM this image"`

* **STOPSIGNAL**: Sets the system call signal that will be sent to exit.
  `STOPSIGNAL SIGTERM`

* **HEALTHCHECK**: Tests the container to check it is working.
  `HEALTHCHECK --interval=5m --timeout=3s CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1`

* **SHELL**: Overrides the default shell used.
  `SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]`

### Best Practices for Writing Dockerfiles

* Use a specific base image.
* Minimize layers by combining commands.
* Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size.
* Order instructions to benefit from layer caching.
* Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the Dockerfile.

### Building Docker Images

To build a Docker image:

```bash
docker build [OPTIONS] PATH | URL | -
```

* **-t, --tag**: Assign a name/tag.

  ```bash
  docker build -t my-app:1.0 .
  ```
* **-f, --file**: Specify a Dockerfile.

  ```bash
  docker build -f my-dockerfile -t my-app .
  ```
* **--build-arg**: Set ARG variables.

  ```bash
  docker build --build-arg VERSION=2.0 -t my-app .
  ```
* **--no-cache**: Build from scratch.

  ```bash
  docker build --no-cache -t my-app .
  ```
* **--pull**: Always pull newer base image.

  ```bash
  docker build --pull -t my-app .
  ```

### Example: Building a Simple Web Application Image

**Project Structure**:

```
app/
├── app.py
└── requirements.txt
```

**app.py**:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, Docker!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
```

**requirements.txt**:

```
Flask==2.0.1
```

**Dockerfile**:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Build the image**:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-app:1.0 .
```

### Running Docker Images as Containers

```bash
docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE [COMMAND] [ARG...]
```

Common options:

* `-d`: Detached mode
* `-p`: Port mapping
  `docker run -p 8080:80 my-app`
* `-e`: Environment variable
  `docker run -e APP_ENV=production my-app`
* `-v`: Volume mount
  `docker run -v /host/data:/container/data my-app`
* `--name`: Assign container name
  `docker run --name my-container my-app`
* `--rm`: Auto-remove container on exit
  `docker run --rm my-app`
* `-it`: Interactive shell
  `docker run -it ubuntu bash`
* `--network`: Connect to network
  `docker run --network my-network my-app`
* `--restart`: Restart policy
  `docker run --restart always my-app`

**Example**:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-python-app:1.0
```

Visit: `http://localhost:5000`

### Managing Running Containers

```bash
docker ps

docker stop my-container

docker start my-container

docker restart my-container

docker rm my-container

docker exec -it my-container bash

docker logs my-container
```

### Continuing the ExampleCorp Project

ExampleCorp is migrating its monolithic application to microservices. Docker is now used to containerize the services like the "User Service" in Python. The service is Dockerized, built into an image, and deployed to infrastructure managed by Terraform and Ansible. This ensures portable and scalable deployments.

### Exercises

1. **Modify the Python web application**: Add a new route, rebuild the image, and verify changes.
2. **Add environment variables**: Use `ENV` and `-e` to customize behavior.
3. **Use a `.dockerignore` file**: Exclude `__pycache__` and verify it's not in the image.
4. **Explore base images**: Try different Python base images and compare size/performance.
