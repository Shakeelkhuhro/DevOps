# Installing and Configuring Docker

Installing and configuring Docker is the foundational step towards leveraging containerization in your DevOps workflow. A successful installation and configuration ensures a smooth experience as you build, ship, and run applications using Docker. This lesson will guide you through the process, covering different operating systems and essential configuration steps.

## Docker Installation

Docker's installation process varies depending on your operating system. We'll cover the most common platforms: Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Installing Docker on Windows

1.  **System Requirements:** Ensure your Windows system meets the following requirements:

    - Windows 10 64-bit Pro, Enterprise, or Education (build 15063 or later). For older versions, Docker Toolbox is an alternative (though deprecated).
    - Hardware virtualization enabled in BIOS.
    - At least 4GB of RAM.

2.  **Download Docker Desktop:** Download the Docker Desktop installer from the official Docker website.
3.  **Run the Installer:** Execute the downloaded installer. Follow the on-screen instructions. Ensure that the "Install required Windows components for WSL 2" option is selected if prompted. WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) provides a Linux kernel, enabling better performance.
4.  **WSL 2 Installation (If Required):** If you don't have WSL 2 installed, Docker Desktop will prompt you to download and install it. Follow the provided instructions, which typically involve enabling the "Virtual Machine Platform" and "Windows Subsystem for Linux" features in Windows Features. You might need to download and install a Linux kernel update package from Microsoft.
5.  **Restart:** After installation, restart your computer.
6.  **Launch Docker Desktop:** Launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu. Accept the terms and conditions. Docker Desktop will start, and you'll see the Docker icon in the system tray.
7.  **Verification:** Open a command prompt or PowerShell and run the following commands to verify the installation:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

    This should display the installed Docker version. Also, run:

    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    This command downloads and runs a test image, confirming that Docker is working correctly.

### Installing Docker on macOS

1.  **System Requirements:** Ensure your macOS system meets the following requirements:

    - macOS Mojave 10.14 or newer.
    - At least 4GB of RAM.

2.  **Download Docker Desktop:** Download the Docker Desktop installer from the official Docker website. Choose the "Docker Desktop for Mac" version.
3.  **Run the Installer:** Double-click the downloaded .dmg file. Drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder.
4.  **Launch Docker Desktop:** Open Docker Desktop from the Applications folder. You might be prompted to grant permissions for Docker to access your system.
5.  **Authentication:** Authenticate with your system password when prompted.
6.  **Verification:** Open a terminal and run the following commands to verify the installation:

    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

    This should display the installed Docker version. Also, run:

    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```

    This command downloads and runs a test image, confirming that Docker is working correctly.

### Installing Docker on Linux (Ubuntu Example)

The installation process varies slightly depending on the Linux distribution. Here's an example for Ubuntu:

1.  **Update Package Index:** Open a terminal and update the package index:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2.  **Install Required Packages:** Install the necessary packages for Docker installation:

```bash
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

3.  **Add Docker's Official GPG Key:** Add Docker's official GPG key to verify the packages:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

4.  **Set Up the Stable Repository:** Add the Docker repository to your system:

```bash
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

5.  **Update Package Index Again:** Update the package index again to include Docker packages:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

6.  **Install Docker Engine:** Install Docker Engine, CLI, and containerd:

```bash
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

7.  **Verify Installation:** Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed correctly:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads and runs a test image, confirming that Docker is working correctly.

8.  **Manage Docker as a Non-root User:** To run Docker commands without `sudo`, add your user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

Log out and log back in for the group membership to take effect.

## Docker Configuration

After installation, some configuration adjustments can optimize Docker's performance and security.

### Configuring Docker Daemon

The Docker daemon manages Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes. Its configuration is typically stored in a daemon.json file.

- **Location:** The location of the daemon.json file varies depending on the operating system:

  - **Linux:** /etc/docker/daemon.json

  - **Windows:** Docker Desktop manages this; direct editing is generally discouraged.

  - **macOS:** Docker Desktop manages this; direct editing is generally discouraged.

- **Creating/Editing the File:** If the file doesn't exist, create it. If it exists, you can edit it to modify the daemon's behavior. You'll typically need sudo privileges on Linux.

- **Restarting the Docker Daemon:** After making changes to the daemon.json file, you need to restart the Docker daemon for the changes to take effect.

  - On Linux, use:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart docker
  ```

  - On Windows and macOS, you can restart Docker Desktop from the system tray icon or through the application settings.

### Common Configuration Options

Here are some common configuration options you can set in the daemon.json file:

- registry-mirrors: Specifies a list of registry mirrors to use for pulling images. This can speed up image downloads, especially in regions with slow connections to the default Docker Hub.

```json
{
  "registry-mirrors": ["https://your-mirror.example.com"]
}
```

*Example:* Many cloud providers offer regional Docker registry mirrors. For example, if you're in China, you might use a mirror provided by a local cloud provider to improve download speeds.

- data-root: Specifies the directory where Docker stores its data, including images, containers, and volumes. Changing this can be useful if you have a dedicated storage volume for Docker.

```json
{
  "data-root": "/mnt/docker-data"
}
```

*Example:* If your root partition is running out of space, you can move the data-root to a larger partition.

- log-driver and log-opts: Configures the logging driver and its options. Different logging drivers are available, such as json-file, syslog, gcplogs, and awslogs.

```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
  }
}
```

*Example:* Using the json-file driver with max-size and max-file options limits the size of log files, preventing them from consuming excessive disk space.

- insecure-registries: Specifies a list of insecure registries to allow Docker to pull images from. This should only be used for development or testing purposes, as it bypasses TLS verification.

```json
{
  "insecure-registries": ["my-insecure-registry.local:5000"]
}
```

*Example:* You might use an insecure registry in a local development environment where you're running a private registry without TLS.

- storage-driver: Specifies the storage driver to use for managing image layers and container data. Common options include overlay2 (recommended for most Linux systems), aufs, and devicemapper.

```json
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

*Example:* overlay2 is generally the preferred storage driver for its performance and efficiency.

### Configuring Docker Desktop (Windows and macOS)

Docker Desktop provides a graphical interface for configuring various settings, including:

- **Resources:** Adjust the amount of CPU, memory, and disk space allocated to the Docker engine.

- **File Sharing:** Configure which directories on your host machine are shared with Docker containers.

- **Network:** Configure network settings, such as port forwarding and proxy settings.

- **Kubernetes:** Enable or disable the built-in Kubernetes support.

- **Update:** Configure update settings.

These settings can be accessed through the Docker Desktop application's preferences or settings menu.

## Post-Installation Verification

After installing and configuring Docker, it's essential to verify that everything is working correctly.

1.  **Check Docker Version:** Run *docker --version* to confirm that Docker is installed and to see the version number.

2.  **Run the hello-world Image:** Run *docker run hello-world* to download and run a test image. If this works, Docker is able to pull images from Docker Hub and run containers.

3.  **Check Docker Info:** Run *docker info* to display detailed information about the Docker installation, including the kernel version, number of containers and images, storage driver, and logging driver. This is useful for troubleshooting.

4.  **List Docker Images:** Run *docker images* to list the images that are currently stored on your system. Initially, this will only show the hello-world image (if you ran it).

5.  **List Docker Containers:** Run *docker ps -a* to list all containers (both running and stopped). After running hello-world, you should see a stopped container.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **"Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"**: This usually indicates that the Docker daemon is not running. On Linux, use sudo systemctl start docker to start it. On Windows and macOS, ensure that Docker Desktop is running.

- **"Permission denied"**: This can occur if you're trying to run Docker commands without sudo on Linux and your user is not in the docker group. Add your user to the docker group and log out and back in.

- **Slow image downloads**: This can be due to network issues or a slow connection to Docker Hub. Consider using a registry mirror.

- **Disk space issues**: Docker images and containers can consume a significant amount of disk space. Monitor your disk usage and consider moving the data-root to a larger partition or using a tool like docker system prune to remove unused images and containers.

## ExampleCorp and Docker Installation

Let's imagine ExampleCorp is setting up their development environment. They've decided to use Docker to ensure consistency across their development, testing, and production environments.

1.  **Operating System Choice:** ExampleCorp's developers primarily use macOS and Ubuntu. The operations team uses Ubuntu servers for deployment.

2.  **Installation:** Developers follow the macOS and Ubuntu installation instructions outlined above. The operations team uses the Ubuntu instructions to install Docker on their servers.

3.  **Configuration:**

    - To speed up image downloads, ExampleCorp configures a registry mirror provided by their cloud provider in the daemon.json file on both developer machines and servers.

    - They also configure the log-driver to json-file with appropriate max-size and max-file options to manage log file sizes.

4.  **Verification:** After installation and configuration, ExampleCorp's developers and operations team members run the verification steps to ensure that Docker is working correctly.

## Exercises

1.  **Install Docker on your system:** Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2.  **Configure a registry mirror:** Find a public registry mirror and configure Docker to use it. Verify that image downloads are faster.

3.  **Change the logging driver:** Change the logging driver to syslog and configure it to send logs to a local syslog server (if you have one).

4.  **Explore Docker Desktop settings:** If you're using Docker Desktop, explore the various settings and experiment with adjusting the resources allocated to Docker.
