# Case Study: Introducing the "ExampleCorp" Project

The "ExampleCorp" project serves as a practical, ongoing case study throughout this course, allowing you to apply DevOps principles and practices in a simulated real-world environment. This lesson introduces the project, its goals, challenges, and the initial state of its IT infrastructure and development processes. Understanding the context of ExampleCorp is crucial for grasping how DevOps can transform an organization and for contextualizing the tools and techniques you'll learn in subsequent modules.

## Introducing ExampleCorp

ExampleCorp is a fictional e-commerce company that sells a variety of products online. They've been in business for five years and have experienced steady growth. However, their IT infrastructure and software development processes haven't kept pace with their business needs, leading to several challenges.

### Business Goals

ExampleCorp's primary business goals are:

- **Increase Revenue:** Expand their customer base and drive more sales through their online platform.
- **Improve Customer Satisfaction:** Provide a seamless and reliable online shopping experience.
- **Reduce Costs:** Optimize their IT infrastructure and development processes to minimize operational expenses.
- **Faster Time to Market:** Quickly release new features and products to stay ahead of the competition.

### Current Challenges

ExampleCorp faces several challenges that hinder their ability to achieve their business goals:

- **Slow Release Cycles:** New features and bug fixes take weeks or even months to deploy to production.
- **Frequent Production Outages:** The website experiences frequent outages due to infrastructure issues and software bugs.
- **Poor Collaboration:** Development, operations, and QA teams work in silos, leading to miscommunication and delays.
- **Manual Processes:** Many IT tasks, such as server provisioning and deployment, are performed manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone.
- **Lack of Automation:** There is little automation in the software development and deployment pipeline.
- **Scaling Issues:** The infrastructure struggles to handle peak traffic during sales events, leading to performance degradation.

## Initial IT Infrastructure

ExampleCorp's current IT infrastructure consists of:

- **On-Premise Data Center:** They host their applications and data in a traditional on-premise data center.
- **Virtual Machines:** They use virtual machines (VMs) to run their applications.
- **Manual Configuration:** Servers are configured manually, leading to inconsistencies and configuration drift.
- **Monolithic Application:** Their e-commerce platform is a monolithic application, making it difficult to update and scale.
- **Traditional Databases:** They use traditional relational databases to store their data.

## Initial Development Processes

ExampleCorp's current development processes are characterized by:

- **Waterfall Model:** They follow a traditional waterfall model for software development.
- **Manual Testing:** Testing is performed manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors.
- **Infrequent Releases:** Releases are infrequent and often involve significant risk.
- **Limited Monitoring:** There is limited monitoring of the production environment, making it difficult to identify and resolve issues quickly.
- **Siloed Teams:** Development, operations, and QA teams work in separate silos with limited communication and collaboration.

## The "Three Ways" at ExampleCorp

As introduced in a previous lesson, the "Three Ways" of DevOps provide a guiding philosophy for improving IT processes. Let's consider how these principles apply to ExampleCorp's situation:

### The First Way: Systems Thinking

- **Current State:** ExampleCorp's teams are siloed, and each team focuses on its own goals without considering the overall system. For example, the development team might release new features without considering the impact on operations.
- **Applying the First Way:** ExampleCorp needs to break down these silos and encourage collaboration between teams. They should focus on optimizing the entire value stream, from development to deployment to operations. This means understanding how each team's work affects the others and working together to improve the overall flow of value to the customer.
- **Example:** Implementing cross-functional teams where developers, operations engineers, and QA specialists work together on the same project. This fosters shared responsibility and a better understanding of the entire system.

### The Second Way: Amplifying Feedback Loops

- **Current State:** Feedback loops are slow and infrequent. For example, it can take days or weeks to get feedback on a new feature from users or operations.
- **Applying the Second Way:** ExampleCorp needs to shorten and amplify feedback loops. This means implementing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment process. It also means implementing monitoring and alerting systems to quickly detect and resolve issues in production.
- **Example:** Implementing automated testing to catch bugs early in the development process. Also, using monitoring tools to track application performance and identify bottlenecks in real-time.

### The Third Way: Culture of Continuous Experimentation and Learning

- **Current State:** There is little experimentation or learning. Teams are afraid to take risks, and there is a culture of blame.
- **Applying the Third Way:** ExampleCorp needs to create a culture of experimentation and learning. This means encouraging teams to experiment with new technologies and processes, and to learn from their mistakes. It also means creating a safe environment where people are not afraid to take risks.
- **Example:** Implementing blameless postmortems to analyze failures and identify areas for improvement. Also, allocating time for teams to experiment with new technologies and processes.

## ExampleCorp's DevOps Transformation: Initial Steps

To address these challenges and achieve their business goals, ExampleCorp has decided to adopt DevOps principles and practices. Here are some initial steps they will take:

- **Form a DevOps Team:** Create a cross-functional team consisting of members from development, operations, and QA. This team will be responsible for driving the DevOps transformation.
- **Implement Version Control:** Migrate their codebase to a version control system like Git (covered in Module 2).
- **Automate Infrastructure Provisioning:** Start using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform (covered in Module 4) to automate the provisioning of their infrastructure.
- **Implement Continuous Integration:** Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) system using tools like Jenkins (covered in Module 3) to automate the build and testing process.
- **Improve Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to track the performance of their applications and infrastructure.

## Preparing for Future Modules

The ExampleCorp case study will be used throughout this course to illustrate how DevOps principles and practices can be applied in a real-world setting. As you progress through the modules, you will learn how to implement the steps outlined above and how to address the challenges faced by ExampleCorp.

In the next module, you will learn about version control with Git, which is a fundamental tool for DevOps. You will learn how to use Git to manage your codebase, collaborate with other developers, and track changes to your code. Understanding Git is essential for implementing CI/CD pipelines and for automating the software development process.
