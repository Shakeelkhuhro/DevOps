## Completing the ExampleCorp Project: Implementing a Full DevOps Pipeline

Continuous deployment represents the culmination of the DevOps pipeline, automating the release of software changes to production. This lesson focuses on implementing a complete DevOps pipeline for ExampleCorp, integrating all the tools and practices covered in previous modules. We'll explore how to orchestrate the entire process, from code commit to production deployment, and lay the groundwork for monitoring and logging, which will be covered in more detail in the next lesson.

## Building the ExampleCorp Continuous Deployment Pipeline

To implement a continuous deployment pipeline for ExampleCorp, we'll integrate the tools and concepts we've learned in previous modules: Git, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and Docker. The goal is to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying ExampleCorp's application whenever a change is committed to the main branch of the Git repository.

### Pipeline Stages

The ExampleCorp pipeline will consist of the following stages:

* **Code Commit**: A developer commits changes to the Git repository.
* **Build**: Jenkins detects the code change and triggers a build job. This job compiles the code, runs unit tests, and creates a Docker image.
* **Test**: Jenkins runs automated integration tests against the newly built Docker image.
* **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Terraform provisions the necessary infrastructure (e.g., servers, load balancers) in the cloud environment.
* **Configuration Management**: Ansible configures the provisioned infrastructure, deploys the Docker image, and starts the application.
* **Deployment**: The application is deployed to the production environment.

## Tool Integration

Let's examine how each tool contributes to the ExampleCorp pipeline:

### Git

Serves as the version control system, tracking all code changes and triggering the pipeline when changes are committed.

* **Example**: A developer pushes a bug fix to the main branch of the ExampleCorp application repository. This push event triggers the Jenkins pipeline.
* **Counterexample**: Changes committed to a feature branch do not automatically trigger the deployment pipeline. This allows developers to work on new features without disrupting the production environment.

### Jenkins

Acts as the orchestration engine, coordinating the entire pipeline. It monitors the Git repository for changes, triggers jobs, and manages the flow of the pipeline.

* **Example**: Jenkins uses a Jenkinsfile (pipeline-as-code) to define the stages of the pipeline, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
* **Counterexample**: Manually triggering deployments or using ad-hoc scripts instead of a Jenkins pipeline would lead to inconsistencies and potential errors.

### Terraform

Provisions and manages the infrastructure required to run the ExampleCorp application.

* **Example**: Terraform creates a virtual machine in AWS, configures networking rules, and sets up a load balancer.
* **Counterexample**: Manually creating and configuring infrastructure would be time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to manage at scale.

### Ansible

Configures the provisioned infrastructure, deploys the application, and ensures that the environment is in the desired state.

* **Example**: Ansible installs Docker on the virtual machine, pulls the latest Docker image from the registry, and starts the container.
* **Counterexample**: Manually configuring servers and deploying applications would be inefficient and inconsistent.

### Docker

Packages the ExampleCorp application and its dependencies into a container, ensuring consistency across different environments.

* **Example**: The Docker image contains the application code, runtime environment, libraries, and dependencies.
* **Counterexample**: Deploying the application directly to the server without containerization would lead to dependency conflicts and inconsistencies.

## Implementing the Pipeline

Here's a step-by-step guide to implementing the ExampleCorp continuous deployment pipeline:

### Set up the Git Repository

Ensure that the ExampleCorp application code is stored in a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### Create a Jenkinsfile

Define the pipeline stages in a Jenkinsfile and store it in the root of the Git repository.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building the application...'
                // Add build steps here (e.g., compile code, run unit tests)
                sh 'docker build -t examplecorp/app .'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running integration tests...'
                // Add integration test steps here
                sh 'docker run examplecorp/app:latest ./run_tests.sh'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying the application...'
                // Add deployment steps here (e.g., Terraform apply, Ansible playbook)
                sh 'terraform init'
                sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve'
                sh 'ansible-playbook deploy.yml'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Configure Jenkins

* Install the necessary Jenkins plugins (e.g., Git, Docker, Terraform, Ansible).
* Create a new Jenkins pipeline job and configure it to use the Jenkinsfile from the Git repository.
* Set up credentials for accessing the Git repository, Docker registry, and cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).

### Write Terraform Configuration

Define the infrastructure required for the ExampleCorp application in a Terraform configuration file.

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "examplecorp_app" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b987c62133c9f" # Replace with your desired AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "examplecorp-app"
  }
}
```

### Write Ansible Playbook

Create an Ansible playbook to configure the provisioned infrastructure, deploy the Docker image, and start the application.

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install Docker
      apt:
        name: docker.io
        state: present
        update_cache: yes

    - name: Pull Docker image
      docker_image:
        name: examplecorp/app:latest
        source: pull

    - name: Run Docker container
      docker_container:
        name: examplecorp-app
        image: examplecorp/app:latest
        ports:
          - "80:8080"
```

### Test the Pipeline

Commit a change to the Git repository and observe the pipeline execution in Jenkins. Verify that each stage completes successfully and that the application is deployed to the production environment.

## Exercises

* **Add Unit Tests**: Integrate unit tests into the "Build" stage of the Jenkins pipeline.
* **Implement Rollbacks**: Implement a rollback mechanism in the pipeline to revert to the previous version of the application in case of a failed deployment.
* **Parameterize the Pipeline**: Parameterize the pipeline to allow users to specify the environment (e.g., development, staging, production) to which the application should be deployed.

## Summary

In this lesson, we implemented a complete continuous deployment pipeline for ExampleCorp, integrating Git, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and Docker. This pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application whenever a change is committed to the Git repository.

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we will explore monitoring and logging, which are essential for ensuring the reliability and performance of the deployed application. We will learn how to use tools like Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the application's health and performance, and how to implement centralized logging to collect and analyze logs from different components of the system.
