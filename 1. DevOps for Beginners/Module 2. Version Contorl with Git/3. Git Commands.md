**Basic Git Commands: init, clone, add, commit, push, pull**  
Git is the backbone of modern DevOps workflows, enabling teams to collaborate efficiently on code and track changes effectively. Understanding basic Git commands is crucial for anyone working in a DevOps environment. This lesson will cover the fundamental Git commands necessary for managing code repositories: init, clone, add, commit, push, and pull. We'll explore each command in detail, providing practical examples and exercises to solidify your understanding. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to confidently perform basic Git operations and contribute to collaborative software development projects.

### **Initializing a Repository: `git init`**  
The `git init` command is used to create a new Git repository. It essentially turns a regular directory into a Git repository, allowing you to start tracking changes to files within that directory.

#### **How `git init` Works**  
When you run `git init` in a directory, Git creates a hidden `.git` subdirectory. This directory contains all the necessary repository metadata, such as configuration files, commit history, and information about branches.

#### **Example: Creating a New Repository**
```bash
cd my-project
git init
```
Output:
```
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my-project/.git/
```

#### **`git init` with `--bare`**  
Bare repositories are used as central repositories for sharing code.

```bash
git init --bare my-bare-repo.git
```

#### **Exercise: Initialize a Local Repository**
1. Create a directory called `my-test-project`.
2. Navigate into it.
3. Run `git init`.
4. Verify the `.git` directory exists.

---

### **Cloning a Repository: `git clone`**  
The `git clone` command is used to create a local copy of an existing Git repository.

#### **How `git clone` Works**  
It downloads all files, commit history, and branches from the remote repository.

#### **Example: Cloning a Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/exampleuser/example-repo.git
```

#### **Cloning into a Specific Directory**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/exampleuser/example-repo.git my-local-repo
```

#### **Exercise: Clone a Repository**
1. Choose a public repository.
2. Copy its clone URL.
3. Run `git clone <URL>`.
4. Navigate into the cloned directory.

---

### **Staging Changes: `git add`**  
The `git add` command stages changes for the next commit.

#### **How `git add` Works**  
You must explicitly stage changes before committing them.

#### **Examples**
- Stage a single file:  
  ```bash
  git add my-file.txt
  ```
- Stage all changes:  
  ```bash
  git add .
  ```
- Stage multiple specific files:  
  ```bash
  git add file1.txt file2.txt
  ```

#### **Exercise: Staging Changes**
1. Create `test.txt` and add text.
2. Run `git add test.txt`.
3. Verify using `git status`.
4. Modify it again, use `git add .`.

---

### **Committing Changes: `git commit`**  
The `git commit` command saves staged changes to the repository history.

#### **How `git commit` Works**  
It creates a new commit object containing changes and metadata.

#### **Examples**
- With a message:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add test.txt file"
  ```
- Without a message (opens editor):
  ```bash
  git commit
  ```

#### **Best Practices**
- Keep messages concise (under 50 characters).
- Be descriptive.
- Use imperative mood: “Add feature” not “Added feature”.

#### **Exercise: Committing Changes**
1. After staging, commit using `-m`.
2. Use `git log` to view history.
3. Modify file again.
4. Commit using editor.
5. Verify using `git log`.

---

### **Pushing Changes: `git push`**  
The `git push` command uploads commits to a remote repository.

#### **How `git push` Works**
Pushes commits from your local branch to the remote.

#### **Example**
```bash
git push origin main
```

#### **Set Upstream Tracking**
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

#### **Exercise: Pushing Changes**
1. Create a repo on GitHub.
2. Clone it.
3. Add `push_test.txt`, stage, and commit.
4. Verify with `git remote -v`.
5. Run `git push origin main`.
6. Confirm on GitHub.

---

### **Pulling Changes: `git pull`**  
The `git pull` command downloads and merges changes from a remote repository.

#### **How `git pull` Works**
It performs:
- `git fetch`
- `git merge`

#### **Example**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### **Dealing with Conflicts**
Git marks conflicts and requires manual resolution (covered later).

#### **Exercise: Pulling Changes**
1. Edit `push_test.txt` directly on GitHub.
2. Save to `main`.
3. Run `git pull origin main` locally.
4. Confirm changes were pulled.

By mastering these basic Git commands, you'll be well-equipped to manage code repositories, collaborate with others, and contribute to software development projects using Git. These commands form the foundation for more advanced Git workflows, such as branching, merging, and conflict resolution, which will be covered in subsequent lessons.
